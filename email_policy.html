<h1>Email Policy</h1>
</div>
<div class='section info-page'>
<p>
MortgageHippo, Inc. ("Company") is dedicated to improving the home financing experience for consumers. Prompt and convenient communication with our clients, vendors, and others is paramount. For that reason, we offer various means of communication including Email, fax, telephone, chat, snail-mail, express mail, voice mail, etc. To demonstrate our commitment to prompt and convenient communications, we have adopted the following terms and conditions regarding Email, which are incorporated by reference into all Emails sent and received by our Team Members (i.e., our employees). Our communications with you via Email are conditioned upon your agreement to the following terms.
</p>
</div>
<div class='separator'></div>
<div class='section info-page'>
<h3>Email in General</h3>
<p>
Email is an effective means of communicating a message. However, due to its brief and informal nature, Email may not accurately represent the entire or final disposition of a matter or the official business records of the Company. In most instances, communications on a particular matter are exchanged through multiple channels such as through Emails, faxes, voicemails, letters, IM, telephone, and in person. Indeed, communications on a particular matter may be exchanged through multiple channels, all at the same time, such as when an Email responds to a voicemail, a fax follows-up a personal meeting, a voicemail responds to an Email, etc. Accordingly, Email, by itself, may not accurately reflect the complete communication or intent of the Company as to the subject matter referred to within the communication, nor constitute an official business record of the Company. All official matters should be subsequently confirmed in signed writings. Also, the mere receipt of an Email by the Company may not put the Company on notice, timely or otherwise, of the matters contained within that Email.
</p>
</div>
<div class='separator'></div>
<div class='section info-page'>
<h3>Emails are generally not formal signed writings; E-Sign Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
Unless there is explicit and specific language and disclosures to the contrary, Emails from our Company do not contain or constitute an electronic signature, even if the sender's name appears in the Email. Email communications are not intended to be construed against the Company as an interest rate lock, an unconditional loan commitment, an unconditional loan approval, unconditional pre-qualification, unconditional pre-approval, or any other unconditional offer or agreement to lend or broker a lender’s loan program. Such documents and agreements are generally sent to clients in formal signed writings from the Company.
</p>
</div>
<div class='separator'></div>
<div class='section info-page'>
<h3>Confidential Information</h3>
<p>
Emails sent by our Team Members are confidential (and all attachments to such Emails are confidential) and are to be reviewed and/or disclosed to only the individual or entity to whom they are addressed and intended. If you received an Email in error or if it was improperly forwarded to you, the information contained in the Email should, at all times, remain confidential and such circumstances shall not authorize you to use or disclose the confidential information. Please notify the sender immediately by telephone or Email, and delete or destroy the original and any copies. Any unauthorized use, disclosure, reproduction, or distribution is strictly prohibited. Emails marked as "Confidential" contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is disclosed under the condition that you treat and maintain such information strictly in a confidential manner and in compliance with applicable privacy laws (including but not limited to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and that you ensure such information is not disclosed or used by others, except for the limited and confidential purpose for which it is being provided. By accepting and reviewing Confidential information provided by the Company, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, or expenses, including attorney's fees that the Company may incur as a result of the unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information due to your acts or omissions.
</p>
</div>
<div class='separator'></div>
<div class='section info-page'>
<h3>Privileged Information</h3>
<p>
Emails exchanged with or involving our Legal Team may contain privileged information subject to the attorney client privilege and/or the attorney work product privilege. Such privileged information shall not be waived if you receive an Email in error or if it was improperly forwarded to you. If you are not the intended recipient of privileged information, please notify the sender immediately by telephone or Email and delete or destroy the original and any copies. Any unauthorized use, disclosure, reproduction, or distribution of confidential or privileged information is strictly prohibited.
</p>
</div>
<div class='separator'></div>
<div class='section info-page'>
<h3>Time sensitive instructions & Official matters; filters</h3>
<p>
Do not use Email to communicate time-sensitive instructions or official company matters; they may not be received or reviewed by the appropriate Team Member in a timely manner. All Emails are processed through various virus and spam filters which may delay or reject the delivery of an Email altogether. Urgent matters should be communicated in person directly with the person of concern via telephone and then confirmed in writing with the appropriate person via fax or Email. The Company reserves the right to block any Email source it deems inappropriate.
</p>
</div>
<div class='separator'></div>
<div class='section info-page'>
<h3>Business Purposes</h3>
<p>
The Company's Email facilities are to be used only for conducting business with our Company. Vendors, suppliers, clients and others receiving Email from our Team Members may not use our Team Member's Email address or contact information (or any other person's Email address appearing on or in Company Email) for any purpose other than corresponding with our Company for lawful and legitimate business purposes relating to the business of our Company.

<p>
All Emails sent to or from our Team Members may be forwarded, monitored, and/or reviewed by others within our Company other than the designated recipient/sender with or without notice to the designated recipient/sender. We may also record or monitor other forms of communications you have with us via the website, PC-talk, chat, Email, and telephone.
