				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year is 2015, and I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the world has changed quite a bit over the last few years. Nowadays people don’t take a cab, they <em>uber</em> it. People don’t stay in hotels, they <em>airbnb</em> it.</p>
<p>Why are these startups so successful at disrupting traditional and established business models? Very simple: they use technology to eliminate process inefficiencies and remove costly intermediaries in the value chain. Oh, and they also make things very easy to use for consumers. It’s the new “consumer revolution”, as some call it.<br />
<span id="more-1849"></span></p>
<p>However, much to the disadvantage of mortgage consumers, the mortgage industry has so far managed to escape the disruptive force of technological advancement. This industry still suffers from antiquated workflows that are not just costly and highly inefficient but are not in any way conducive to providing a satisfactory consumer experience. Borrowers today are still submitting documents through fax and email, mediums that lack proper security standards for transmitting sensitive information and lead to messy and disorganized transactions. Worst of all, borrowers today are still dazed and confused as they go through an overwhelming and confusing <a title="What to Expect from the Mortgage Process" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/what_to_expect" target="_blank">mortgage process</a>.</p>
<p>But this is all finally changing with the emergence of innovative technology companies taking on the massive challenge of bringing mortgages into the 21st Century. Now it’s the mortgage industry’s turn for a long overdue focus on significantly improving the consumer experience. It’s the dawn of a new era for mortgages, one to which we refer as <em>the age of no more</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more obsolete and antiquated workflows that make lenders, loan officers and borrowers inefficient</li>
<li>No more obscurity into the mortgage process for consumers</li>
<li>No more disorganized transactions that lead to errors and delays</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, we’re very happy to announce <a title="MortgageHippo Loan Closing Plan" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/advanced_closing_plan" target="_blank">MortgageHippo’s new customized loan closing plan</a>. We designed this closing plan to walk home buyers and people looking to refinance through every single step of the mortgage process in a very friendly, intuitive and smart interface and provide loan officers and borrowers with a centralized hub to complete the entire mortgage transaction in a very organized manner.</p>
<p>From their loan closing plan, borrowers can get thoroughly and automatically pre-qualified, compare loan options and pricing, examine <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">closing costs</a>, upload all necessary documents, keep track of their loan application, invite other important parties to the transaction (such as <a title="When Should You Use a Real Estate Agent to Buy a Home?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-should-you-use-a-real-estate-agent-to-buy-a-home/" target="_blank">real estate agents</a>), communicate with their loan officer, and much more.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning! Although calling this the beginning is really a misnomer, since this is a journey that probably has no end. Or do you ever really finish improving and innovating? I certainly hope not. As Jiro Ono – the 85-year-old master sushi chef – wonderfully phrased it in the documentary <em>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit. There is always a yearning to achieve more. I&#8217;ll continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is.”</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Ramon Robinson</em></p>
<p>It’s not an overstatement to say that AirBnB and Couchsurfing have been major forces behind some of my biggest life developments. Two years ago, I embarked upon a 108-day journey to build a global network of friends from those home sharing sites. The itinerary, which led to a doubling of my Facebook friends total, looked like this:<span id="more-542"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1859" src="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing-2.png" alt="mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing-2" width="950" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Since then, my goals have changed quite a bit. I’ve been writing for <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">MortgageHippo</a> – a company that, much like these home sharing sites are doing with renting and lodging, wants to simplify and improve the home-buying process through technology. Most of the people with whom I work are also in their early 30s, and even though they’re passionate about travel, they recognize the importance of a solid home to which to return from backpacking expeditions. In conversation with them, I couldn’t help but wonder: What do I want in a home, and how do I reconcile my passion for traveling a lot with my desire for a home I can really call my own?</p>
<p>To answer that question, I decided to go home sharing abroad again with this itinerary:</p>
<p><a href="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing_itne2013-2014.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1860" src="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing_itne2013-2014.png" alt="mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing_itne2013-2014" width="950" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>It would be the stickiest of bubblegum stretches to say that I returned to Chicago with a firm sense of place in the world, confident in my vision of my future as a head of household, with hands tightly clasping the financial, intellectual and social capital required to realize that vision. What has instead materialized from conversations with my AirBnB and Couchsurfing hosts, recent and distant past, is this little guide to exploiting home sharing sites to gain clarity about the right home for oneself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 1<br />
When you find yourself home sharing in a part of the world that’s amenable to your long-term interests, seriously consider just living there. If your hosts are good personality matches, they may even agree to let you stay with them until you can reestablish yourself in the new city or country</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just the stuff of fiction: Even in “this economy,” people who may have several decades of life ahead of them are quitting their jobs, renting their apartments out, and even selling their homes to couchsurf while traveling. Their time spent test driving homes and lifestyles around the world lasts anywhere from months to years, often thanks to the advent of these free home sharing sites.</p>
<p>Short-term home sharing – the kind that doesn’t require completely dispensing with your safety net – can yield revelations about the ideal place to invest in a home too: During my second stay in Macedonia this past spring, my friend Emilija Damjanovic – a costume jeweler in the capital city of Skopje – remarked that her interactions with American couchsurfers like me made her grateful to live in a country where it’s normal to continue living with ones parents well into adulthood. “What I hear about the U.S. is that even with a good salary, you have a hard time finding a new home that does not come with big problems,” she said over a multi-course lunch not costing more than $5 USD total for the two of us. “The living conditions in New York and San Francisco just sound disgusting to me. Here, I have a large room of my own and feel no shame about living with my parents at 40, since many other adult Macedonians live with their parents too.”</p>
<p>Can you imagine how much money Americans could save, and how amazing the homes we’d ultimately build for ourselves would be, if there weren’t a cultural imperative to have our own places before we’re financially established? One way of fighting that imperative, or any other that ails you, would be to relocate where it doesn’t exist. Home sharing while you’re gathering your bearings would make that a much less expensive proposition than it might otherwise be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 2<br />
It might be okay to think small. Beyond traditional homes and apartments, home sharing sites offer hippie bus, tiny house and tree house stays. Stay overnight in the most sustainable of the three living options – the tiny houses. </strong></p>
<p>AirBnB has been a godsend – a sort of fairy godmother-send, to be precise – for my childhood friend Klara. Beyond permitting her access to most of the amenities of a private hotel suite at prices within her SF Bay Area librarian’s budget, it also allows her to play house at the ripe old age of thirty. She always books places to stay without a host present for this reason: “It’s much easier to pretend I live there if the actual owner isn’t wandering around.”</p>
<p>The good news for Klara and all you other domestic bliss dreamers out there is that there are fully-appointed, owner personality-infused rentals where you can play house for a while, even in a community of other whimsical types also playing house. Then if you decide that they should be your real homes, you can buy them furnished as they were when you were a guest in them. I read about these toy-to-true abodes in The New Yorker before I began spotting them in places like rural Louisiana, the English countryside, and even along the railways of Eastern Europe this past trip. They’re called TINY HOUSES: Low impact, multipurpose, portable living units that are exactly what their name suggests. For those listed on AirBnB, the owner is often present in a nearby big house for guidance on tiny house living. House hunting fans of the 1939 Judy Garland film The Wizard of Oz will be giddy upon hearing that one tiny house currently available for rent through the site is even shaped like a mushroom, while another was constructed from mushrooms. In other words: Welcome to sustainable Munchkinland, folks, and make yourself at home!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 3<br />
If you happen to move from one bad home sharing experience to another, keep a healthy perspective: You can learn a lot about what you want in a home even by comparing an undesirable option to a more undesirable option.</strong></p>
<p>If there’s one thing that has left me in awe of even the modest homes where I’ve stayed on travels, it’s my memory of the shadiest ones where I’ve stayed both as a resident and as a traveler.</p>
<p>As a graduate student visiting New Orleans for my 29th birthday: I booked a place described as a “stylish, comfortable and functional room” in a “peaceful and serene neighborhood” just “a short walk to the Legendary French Quarter.” The quality of the room was understated: With its gold, yellow and black trimmings, Mardis Gras wall masks, and books recalling the city’s history, the room was so inviting that I often didn’t leave it for sightseeing until early afternoon. Unfortunately, I discovered on a casual stroll recommended by my hosts that the neighborhood only appeared serene because its residents preferred to remain locked inside. Nightly police sirens from all compass angles signaled that I’d better run back to the house if I couldn’t hail a taxi along the way. “What the hell do you mean ‘it doesn’t seem safe’?,” one of my hosts would say as I’d rush inside after desperately fumbling with the keys to unlock the front door. “Hurricane Katrina turned this into one of the safest neighborhoods in the city.” This host bore a diagonal knife wound from his left ear to his right cheek, courtesy of a man he’d killed in combat during the Gulf War, and the most conspicuous manifestation of his PTSD was his habit of building traps for roosters in the B&amp;B’s yard and axing them into mattress and meat pie filling for fun before brushing his teeth in the morning.</p>
<p>Such cringe-worthy experiences informed my appreciation for my most recent AirBnB – one that some call haunted while others, including me, call it charming. It’s located in the Scottish town of Dumfries, otherwise known as the gateway to the site of the 1988 Lockerbie air disaster. My Dumfries hosts were imbued with a sort of controlled jolliness – as if they were only allowing themselves to appear tipsy enough for legitimate Scotsman-ship, despite possessing the permanent internal sobriety common among survivors of a mass tragedy. The house suggested the same paradox: Fluffy red velvet curtains and bedspreads contrasted by narrow stained glass windows, and a rather dimly lit den where the host’s children were encouraged to ride tricycles in small circles ad infinitum. It wasn’t the prettiest picture of home and family, but I’d look for inspiration in a home suggesting peaceful resignation any day over ones asking me to rest on high alert.</p>
<p>With that in mind, as you’re investigating homes, just remember this: You might learn even more about what you need in a house by comparing bad ones to better ones than you would by projecting yourself into a rental so splendid that it feels at odds with your true persona.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 4<br />
The person or people with whom you can share a mortgage, and a lifetime, may be awaiting you at an AirBnB or Couchsurfing home.</strong></p>
<p>Officially, you’re in violation of Couchsurfing.org policies if you use the website as a dating or hookup application. That said, love knows no e-bounds, and I’ve met people who found their husbands, wives and home co-investors through home sharing sites. It makes good sense: Home sharing sites encourage people to profile their homes and interests so that they can be matched with people who share those interests and would like to spend at least one night in those homes.</p>
<p>The story of Alexis and Kyle Kleinbeck illustrates at least three ways to approach this step: The couple introduced themselves to one another at a meet-up for Couchsurfers in Cincinatti, Ohio. Sidestepping any obligations to the invisible Big Brother figures at Couchsurfing.org, they allowed their flame to kindle and decided to marry in Autumn 2013. At their wedding in Wisconsin, guests from as far as Alaska and India – including other Couchsurfers – were invited to camp out in the backyard of Kyle’s mom’s house in Wisconsin for a whole weekend. The gathering was an enormous hit, and the Kleinbecks later used their wedding party in combination with Couchsurfers they met as husband and wife to build an international living community. Now that they have a strong network of friends and wedding guests around the world, they can probably generate a substantial amount of funding for any home and lifestyle initiatives they have in mind should they ever want to do that. As a recent Forbes article suggests, the Kleinbecks could even crowd-finance a home using donations from their personal Couchsurfing community on websites like Crowd Estates and Indiegogo.</p>
<p>The three major takeaways here are: 1) Built-in crowdfunding circles 2) Members passionate about communal living scenarios in which dozens of people split the household bills and 3) Wealthy spouse and benefactor prospects. Could home sharing sites be a quick-fix for the lonely and loveless? That may just be the hot topic for my next trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 5<br />
You can use home sharing sites to pay your mortgage. Maybe.</strong></p>
<p>Using AirBnB to pay ones mortgage and avoid being tied to a traditional job is something of a phenomenon: One couple made nearly $349 between four guests sleeping in their living room over a single night. Another couple are prepared to describe themselves on LinkedIn as an AirBnB Real Estate Tycoons. My New Orleans host retired from the military in middle age to make a living renting out rooms in his home on AirBnB, and despite the revelation that his neighborhood is The ‘Hood, he seems to be living well off his profits. And, surprise, surprise: A “<a href="http://www.lulu.com/ca/en/shop/stephen-liddell/how-to-get-rich-using-airbnb/ebook/product-21175161.html" target="_blank">Get Rich Quick Using AirBnB</a>” self-help book is in online circulation now.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, there are legal issues associated with home sharing rentals in some states: Some leasers have been evicted for renting out rooms in their apartments on AirBnB. Others have found that they have no legal recourse when guests damage their property. And in a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-host-cant-get-squatter-to-leave-2014-7" target="_blank">news item</a> that has gone viral, one AirBnB host in Palm Springs, Cory Tschogl, is currently being sued by a guest squatting in her property. The reason for this is that in California, if someone rents a room for over 30 days, he becomes a tenant and can only be evicted through the traditional three to six month process requiring up to $5,000 in legal fees. Those are some of the reasons why I can’t blindly recommend AirBnB and other paid home stay arrangements as a means of paying off your mortgage.</p>
<p>However, if you can iron out the details of a host-guest agreement in advance of any stays so that you’re covered legally, you may never have to think about foreclosure again. That’s something I plan to keep in mind for the home of my unforeseeable future.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 6<br />
Don’t just show guests their rooms and vanish for the remainder of their stays all the time. Host too!</strong></p>
<p>Settled into the right home? Then host in it! Once you&#8217;ve caught the home sharing bug, &#8216;home sweet home&#8217; will always be sweeter with more people in it.</p>
<p>And to get you there along the path of least resistance, here’s an ideal itinerary you can follow to get the house of your dreams. Click on the map below to start your journey:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To rent or buy, that is the question many of you have when looking for your new home. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll take a look at the pros and cons of buying vs renting a home. Once you know the advantages and disadvantages of both renting and buying, you&#8217;ll have the right tools to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>The recent economic crisis has prompted some to question our views towards homeownership. However, questioning homeownership for this economic disaster is distracting from the real issues that will lead us to create a more effective and <a title="Wall of Shame: Beware of Deceptive Mortgage Advertising Practices" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/wall-of-shame-beware-deceptive-mortgage-advertising-practices/" target="_blank">transparent housing market</a>.</p>
<p class="c11">There were many factors that contributed significantly to the recent economic crisis. Among them: the credit rating agencies that did not adequately assess the risk of mortgage-backed securities, <a title="Why We Don’t Like Mortgage Referral Sites (And Why You Shouldn’t Either)" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites/" target="_blank">unscrupulous mortgage brokers</a> selling risky loans to homebuyers who did not fit the risk profile, an out-of-whack mortgage industry that allowed consumers to buy homes without verifying their income or assets (or barely anything else for that matter), etc.</p>
<p class="c11">Responsible homeownership was not one of those factors. In fact, responsible homeownership was one of the reasons why the crisis wasn’t worse.</p>
<p><span id="more-524"></span></p>
<p class="c11">The focus of our industry going forward should be to create a culture of responsible homeownership. This starts with us – the professionals in the industry – educating our clients about mortgage products and features to help them make informed decisions and even letting them know when we don’t think they’re ready to buy a home. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve created the best <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> for home buyers.</p>
<p class="c11">With this in mind, let’s take a look at the top three pros and cons of buying vs renting:</p>
<p class="c11"><span class="c9"><strong>Cons of Buying a Home:</strong></span></p>
<p class="c11 c8"><span class="c2"><strong>1. Restricted mobility</strong></span></p>
<p class="c11 c8"><span class="c3">Leaving a rental property is much easier than selling your home or keeping your home and renting it out to someone else. Generally speaking, if you’re not planning to stay in your home for at least four years, buying a home may not be the best option. </span></p>
<p class="c11 c8"><span class="c2"><strong>2. Property upkeep</strong> </span></p>
<p class="c11 c8"><span class="c3">Buying a home, especially a single-family home, requires maintaining the property. You should always budget for this additional cost when buying a home. When you rent, your landlord is responsible for damages to the property not caused by you.</span></p>
<p class="c11 c8"><span class="c2"><strong>3. Upfront investment</strong> </span></p>
<p class="c11 c8"><span class="c3">Buying a home requires a substantial upfront investment to cover the <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a> and <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">closing costs</a>. Although your down payment builds equity in your home, and you can recapture that value later on when you sell the property, it can be a decent sum of cash with which you have to part for the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c11"><span class="c9"><strong>Pros of Buying a Home:</strong></span></p>
<p class="c11"><span class="c13"><strong>1. You get to live in an asset that appreciates in value over time</strong></span></p>
<p class="c11">We are just humans with basic needs, and among those basic needs is the need for shelter. Considering the alternatives (living out in the woods as a caveman or renting), owning your home helps you kill two birds with one stone: satisfying your basic need for shelter and accumulating wealth through the appreciation of your home (which historically has been over 5% per year).</p>
<p class="c11"><span class="c13"><strong>2. A customized living experience</strong></span></p>
<p class="c11">As they say, you are the king or queen of your own palace. When you own your home, you can paint the walls any color you want, change the floors, redo the kitchen, etc.  But when you rent, you’re at the mercy of your landlord’s style. That being said, I’m sure your landlord wouldn’t mind if you spent $20,000 upgrading the kitchen, but then how will you recapture that value?</p>
<p class="c11"><span class="c13"><strong>3. Tax deduction</strong></span></p>
<p class="c11">If you itemize deductions on your tax return, the <a title="Tax 101: Mortgage Interest Deductions" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/tax-101-mortgage-interest-deductions/" target="_blank">mortgage interest rate tax deduction</a> can save you thousands in taxes every year. And while we’re on the topic of homes and taxes, did you know that homeowners are exempt from paying capital gains tax on the first $250,000 of profit when they sell their primary residence? The exemption goes up to $500,000 of profit for married homeowners. By the way, you should always consult your tax professional about your taxes.</p>

<p class="c11">Still have doubts about this important decision?</p>
<p class="c11">Let’s take a look at two scenarios – one where you rent and another where you buy – to see how they impact your financial situation over the course of 30 years.</p>
<p class="c11"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a>To make the analysis simple, we have isolated all possible financial variables by assuming that there is only one financial decision you will have to make over this 30-year period: whether to buy or rent. In both scenarios, you start with $50,000 in your bank account. In the buy scenario, you use the $50,000 towards your down payment. In the rent scenario, you invest the $50,000.</p>
<p class="c11">To make things even simpler, we ignored the closing costs associated with buying a home (which, in this scenario, could have added to about $5,000). However, to be as precise as possible, we also ignored the mortgage interest tax deduction homeowners receive, which can lead to thousands of dollars in savings per year.</p>
<p class="c11"><span class="c14"><a class="c18" href="https://docs.google.com/a/hippoteq.com/spreadsheets/d/1o_kwqUmRc_rNeNFdRq4pko1l2s5Sx7Xx1AZ0hy2tr2I/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">View the two scenarios here</a></span>.</p>
<p>Of course, we encourage every home buyer, especially a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a>, to use our tools to run the numbers for yourself and see if owning is best for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Improving your credit score is very important to your financial health. The lower the score the more risky you are perceived by the lenders, which is reflected in being charged a higher interest rate on your loans or being denied credit altogether if the score is below a required minimum.<span id="more-513"></span></p>
<p>Before laying out the tactics for how to improve your credit score, let’s talk about how credit scores affect mortgage loans. Yes, I said scores, not a score, because virtually all of us have three credit scores from three credit reporting agencies: Experian, Equifax and Transunion.</p>
<p>Which one of those credit scores actually matter? The answer is the median one (or the lower if you only have two scores). For example, if your scores are 700, 710 and 720, the score used for loan qualification purposes is the middle one: the 710.</p>
<p>The <a title="What Recent Credit Score Changes Mean For Home Buyers" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/recent-credit-score-changes-mean-home-buyers/" target="_blank">qualifying credit score</a> determines your loan’s interest rate and the rate paid on <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">mortgage insurance</a> (if applicable). If too low, it can immediately disqualify you from obtaining a loan, even if other positive factors exist. Simply put, if your score is too low, you might not qualify for a loan regardless of how much money you make or the size of your <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a>.</p>
<p>We are not a credit repair service and we cannot comment on the claims that those services make regarding an immediate improvement to your credit scores, but we want to provide you with some simple and common solutions to improve your credit scores.</p>
<p>The two biggest components of your credit score calculation are 1) the amount of debt you carry on your credit cards and other revolving lines of credit, and 2) making payments on time. If your score is below a desired level and there are some late payments that occurred within the last 12 months, there is little you can do to fix it (short of jumping into your Delorean and getting up to 88MPH) except to ensure that all future payments are made on time (on time usually means within 30 days from the due date).</p>
<p>The lower your total revolving debt, relative to the total revolving limit (aggregate of all credit card limits), the better the credit score. If your total revolving debt level exceeds 30% of the total revolving credit limit, there is quite a bit you can do to improve your scores by paying down that debt.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that neither one of those paths provides an immediate improvement to the score. Making payments on time and paying down the debt will take a few months to take effect.</p>
<p>What if you don’t have much credit history due to your young age or the fact that you are one of the lucky few that had gone through life without having to borrow much? The easiest and the fastest way to build credit history is by responsibly using a credit card. If you don’t have a credit card and have a limited credit history, your best bet is a secured credit card.</p>
<p>Here’s how a secured credit card works: you provide a cash collateral equal to the amount of the credit limit, which allows the credit card provider to recoup their losses in case you end up not paying off the balance. Secured credit cards, once fairly popular with major banks, are now pretty much only offered by credit unions and smaller community banks, but it’s worth asking your bank regardless.</p>
<p>A <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a> might be surprised at how much credit score affects the interest rate on a mortgage loan.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few people know about down payment assistance programs. When talking to potential homebuyers, one issue that is consistently brought up is lack of savings to pay for down payment.</p>
<p>First, there is the misconception out there that you <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">need 20% down payment</a> to purchase a home. Is it great to have 20% and <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">avoid paying private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI)? Yes, of course. Is it necessary? Definitely not. You can have as little as 5% down payment on conventional loans and 3.5% on FHA loans.</p>
<p>The second misconception, and the one I want to focus on today, is that if you don’t have enough money saved up to even pay the 5% down payment, then you can’t purchase the home. There are many down payment assistance grants, interest-free second mortgages, and other mortgage programs out there to help potential home buyers with the issue of lack of down payment.<span id="more-489"></span></p>
<p>These down payment assistance programs are plentiful and cover the gamut of home buyers, and you don’t have to be a low-income household to qualify for many of these programs. In fact, in some areas of the country you can earn considerably more than your area’s median income and still be eligible for down payment assistance. Sometimes high-income earners can qualify for a grant of up to 5% of the purchase price of the home!</p>
<p>So how much can you expect to get in assistance? The average assistance can go anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the city, county, or state that you live in. In some high-cost areas, the down payment assistance can be as much as $100,000. A lot of these down payment programs are setup as a silent, interest-free, second mortgage that only needs to be repaid when the home is sold or paid-off.</p>
<p>I want to make the caveat that just because you can access down payment assistance programs, it does not mean that you should be purchasing a home that’s pricier than you can afford.</p>
<p>First you should always <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">determine how much home you can afford</a> (monthly mortgage payment plus other costs). If you don’t have the 5% down payment for that home price saved up, or you simply don’t want to use all of your savings on a down payment, start looking at down payments assistance programs to cover the remaining down payment amount.</p>
<p>The important thing for lenders is that you have decent credit and can document your income thoroughly: they want to make sure that you have the ability to repay the loan. If the home you’re purchasing qualifies for a down payment assistance program and your lender is signed up to participate in that particular program that you’re interested in, they will handle the paperwork to help you get the assistance.</p>
<p>In addition to offering the most thorough <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>, MortgageHippo also helps <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a> find down payment assistance programs to help them out.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is very important for you to keep an eye on your credit score and credit report. Your credit is the single most important factor in determining how much you pay for a home loan. Don’t believe us? Let us prove it to you very briefly:</p>
<p>Someone with a 740 credit score buying a $250,000 single family home with 20% down payment would qualify for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at an interest rate of 4.125%. The monthly payment (principal and interest only – not including taxes and <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">mortgage insurance</a>) at this rate would come out to $969 per month.</p>
<p>Someone buying the same home with the same percentage of <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a> but with a credit score of 640 would qualify for the same 30-year fixed rate mortgage at an interest rate of 4.625%, increasing the monthly payment to $1,028 per month. That’s almost $720 more per year or $7,200 over a 10-year period, not taking into account the time value of money.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve made this very important point, and hopefully convinced you about the importance of <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">improving your credit score</a>, we’re happy to tell you that there is good news on the credit horizon:<span id="more-480"></span></p>
<p>The leading credit scoring company – the Fair-Isaac Corporation (known as FICO) – has made important changes to its credit score model that could result in higher credit scores for millions of consumers. The new credit score computations will change in two important ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Medical bills will no longer be weighed as heavily as it did in previous versions of FICO’s credit score model.</li>
<li>Any collections that have already been paid will be ignored.</li>
</ol>
<p>Considering that medical bills account for about half of all unpaid collections, this is certainly nothing to sneeze at. However, before we all get too excited about this great news and what this means for home buyers, we must still wait for these new rules to go into effect and we must also wait for mortgage lenders to adopt these new credit standards (something they have been slow to do in the past, and some will even opt out of adopting new models).</p>
<p>The important thing to keep in mind is that – even though credit score changes are made from time to time – taking control of your credit is always a good idea. I can guarantee that using credit responsibly and paying your bills on time will always lead to higher credit scores and therefore lower interest rates on most loans you take out, including your mortgage.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to check your credit for mistakes; you would be surprised how many times people find errors on their credit report.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Down payment gift money has become an increasingly popular source of funds for first time homebuyers. John Mayer says: “fathers be good to your daughters.” Today, we want to reverse and amplify that to say: “daughters and sons be good to your mothers and fathers&#8230; and even other relatives too.”</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, they are literally the reason you are here, but they can also be a great source of down payment funds for that dream home you’ve been looking to buy.<span id="more-471"></span></p>
<p>First off, let’s set the record straight when it comes to down payments. You DO NOT need to put a <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">20% down payment to buy a home</a>. That is a myth that needs to be debunked immediately. That being said, if you can put 20% down, you would avoid paying <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage insurance</a> (mortgage insurance protects the lender in the event you default on your loan). But if you can’t put 20% down, you can put down as little as 5% with most conventional loan programs. You can even go down to 3.5% with an FHA loan (but that carries certain additional expenses we will discuss at a later time). To see your different down payment options and loan programs, check out our <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>.</p>
<p>Now back to the specific matter at hand: a down payment gift.</p>
<p>Simply stated, a down payment gift is a gift of liquid monetary value to be used for the specific purpose of putting money down for the purchase of a residential property. As the name implies, it’s a gift. It’s not a loan that must be repaid; the lender will make sure to document it as such.</p>
<h2>Documenting the Gift</h2>
<p>The lender will typically require a down payment <i>gift letter</i> from the gifter (the person making the gift, e.g., your mom) stating that the funds do not need to be repaid. If the down payment gift money must be repaid, it’s considered a loan (not a gift) and its payment must be factored into your monthly expenses.</p>
<p>In addition to making it clear that the funds are a gift, the <i>down payment gift letter</i> should also state the amount and date of the gift, the subject property address (the address of the property you are buying), and the relationship between the gifter and the giftee (that’s you, by the way).</p>
<p>Most lenders will also require a full paper trail of the transfer of funds from the gifter to the giftee. This can be accomplished in multiple ways and depends on the type of transfer that occurred.</p>
<p>The easiest and most common way is for the gifter to write a check for the exact gift amount to the giftee. In this case, you can submit a copy of the check (both sides) as proof of transfer as well as the giftee’s bank statement showing that the check cleared. The gifter will also need to provide a bank account statement showing the funds for the gift being withdrawn from the gifter’s account.</p>
<p>Note: if the gifted funds were not in the gifter’s bank account for a certain period of time (two statement cycles) prior to the down payment gift being made, you must also keep a paper trail tracing the funds back to its original source. For example, let’s say your dad sold some stock from his brokerage account to give you the down payment gift. In that case, the lender will ask for evidence of the stock sale and the transfer of funds from your dad’s brokerage account to the bank account from which the gift was made.</p>
<p>The gifter can also wire the funds to the giftee. Although this may be simpler than writing a check, showing evidence of a wire is harder, and the name of the game is to make things as simple as possible for the lender. Trust me, it’s for your own good.</p>
<p>Also in the spirit of maximum simplicity, it is highly advisable that the giftee deposit the down payment gift money into the same bank account where the rest of the funds that will be used for closing are coming from (i.e. the rest of your down payment funds, funds to cover <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">closing costs</a> and financial reserves that may be required by the lender).</p>
<h2>Other Important Stuff About Gifts</h2>
<ul>
<li>It used to be that if you were buying a home with at least 20% down, ALL of your down payment could come from a down payment gift, but if you were putting less than 20% down, a big chunk of the down payment amount had to come from the borrower and not from a gift. New rules are making this requirement less stringent and allowing borrowers to use gift money for their entire down payment, even if the total down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price, as long as they are purchasing a one unit primary residence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can only use down payment gifts to purchase a primary or second home, but not for an investment property. With FHA loans, you can only use gift funds for a primary home.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want to completely avoid documenting the gift money for a down payment, you can do this by making sure the funds are in your bank account at least three months prior to submitting your bank account statements to the lender for the first time. This is referred to as “seasoning” of funds. The lender will only scrutinize your bank account activity for the last two statement cycles. Any funds deposited into your bank account before then are “seasoned” and the lender will generally not inquire about them. By the way, this is perfectly legal (we’re not teaching you how to deceive your lender here).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>There may be tax implications for making and receiving gifts, so make sure to consult your tax advisor (or maybe your parents’ tax advisor).</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oh, and please don’t forget to thank your gifter(s) – it’s the right thing to do!</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deceptive mortgage advertising practices are unfortunately very common. I spend a lot of time online reading about mortgages and the mortgage industry. My email client must have picked up on this because yesterday one of the ads in my email feed read something like this: “Mortgage Rates at 2.5%.” As a mortgage professional, I knew they must be referring to an Adjustable Rate Mortgage because, in today’s market, there is simply no way any lender out there could offer that <a title="Low Mortgage Rates: Don’t Fall Prey to Lender Advertisements" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/low-mortgage-rates-advertisements/" target="_blank">low mortgage rate</a> on a 30-year fixed, which is the most popular loan option among most borrowers out there (and for good reason). Curious to find out how they would sell it on their site, I clicked on the ad.<span id="more-451"></span> <a href="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/photo-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1914" src="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/photo-1.png" alt="photo-1" width="283" height="400" /></a> Still no mention of the loan program for this fabulous low rate. And now they were really going for the kill by adding that this loan contained “No Hidden Fees, Points, or Closing Costs!” As a lay consumer, I would have been hooked. Get me this low mortgage rate now PLEASE! Looking for a full disclosure of the advertised rate, as is required by law, I noticed a link on their site. It was a small, light gray link juxtaposed over an also light gray background. It said “terms &amp; conditions” (no exclamation mark this time, just “terms &amp; conditions”). It was almost as if they were asking me not to click on it and to just direct my attention to the big orange button below to get me on my merry way. Despite the luring big orange button, I of course clicked on the very shy “terms &amp; conditions” link. Don’t get me wrong, all online companies use color, font size, and punctuation to guide users through their site. It’s just that not all sites hide very important information behind subtle links. It really bothers me when sites do this. This is what I found after clicking on “terms &amp; conditions”. <a href="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/photo-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1915" src="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/photo-2.png" alt="photo-2" width="258" height="400" /></a> Incidentally, the colors were all gone and all the text was lumped together into large paragraphs begging me not to read them. They were screaming at me: “close this window and just go back to that big, sexy orange button in the previous screen!” Unafraid and relentless to find what I was looking for, I read on. I found it! I found the assumptions they were hiding in the dooms of their site. Be my guest and read them for yourself. I dare you! It’s ok if you’re too afraid. I understand. Let me summarize them. I’ll even increase the font size for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6>The 2.5% rate is for a 5-year Adjustable Rate Mortgage</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>The borrower must have good to excellent credit</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>The borrower must have average income</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>The borrower must be seeking a loan for a single family, owner occupied one unit dwelling</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>The borrower must put 30% down payment</h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a borrower, I think I would want to know this information upfront. After all, these assumptions exclude the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6>Everyone with average credit or worse</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Everyone with below average income</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Everyone looking for a non-single family property</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Everyone looking for a second home or investment property</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Everyone who can’t afford to put 30% down payment</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>AND everyone not looking for a 5-year Adjustable Rate Mortgage</h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Adjustable Rate Mortgages Are Not Evil" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/adjustable-rate-mortgages-not-evil/" target="_blank">Adjustable Rate Mortgages are great products</a>, but they’re certainly not for everyone. In fact, for the vast majority of borrowers – especially in today’s interest rate environment – a fixed-rate mortgage is the better option. So why advertise an Adjustable Rate Mortgage with such stringent requirements when this particular loan product is only a good fit for the minority of borrowers? Because they can. Because it’s an attention grabber. Because <a title="Low Mortgage Rates: Don’t Fall Prey to Lender Advertisements" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/low-mortgage-rates-advertisements/" target="_blank">most mortgage companies don’t care if they’re misleading</a> you so long as you go to their site and use them to get a mortgage, even if you end up paying way more than what they initially advertised. Because it’s an incredibly deceptive and perfectly legal (yes, this is unfortunately legal) way of getting consumers to notice you. Last but not least, because it works; and uninformed consumers fall for these predatory advertising tactics. We’re not here to preach about what is right and wrong or change what we can’t control. Since we can’t control how other companies in our industry behave, we’re not even necessarily here to change their practices (except to the extent we can show them that it pays to be honest and transparent). Our role is to inform and warn you – the mortgage consumer – and let you decide with whom you want to do business. But now you know that there is a better way to get a mortgage online, and with the deepest sense of humility, I can firmly state that <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">MortgageHippo</a> is that better way. We&#8217;ve built a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> like no other, geared towards providing the most accurate and up-to-date interest rates based on your unique profile. We even go the next step for <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a> and guide you throughout the entire home buying process. P.S. This particular company is not the only one adopting this deceptive advertising practice. Most mortgage companies unfortunately play this dirty game.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Finally, a full breakdown of mortgage closing costs that is easy to digest. Say you’ve found the perfect home, have gotten a mortgage pre-approval, and have a good sense of what you’ll be paying in <a title="Infographic: Monthly Mortgage Payment and Closing Costs Breakdown" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/monthly-mortgage-payment-breakdown/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage payments</a>. You also have a <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment </a>set aside that you’ve saved up especially for your dream home. You’re all set, right? Well, not just yet. In addition to your down payment, mortgage closing costs are upfront expenses that you’ll want to keep in mind when approaching the home buying process, especially if you&#8217;re a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a> – and not all mortgage companies set the expectation for what this amount will turn out to be.<span id="more-445"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">What are mortgage closing costs? Simply, they are fees charged directly by the lender and/or third parties involved in the mortgage transaction that are due at the time of closing. While sellers are sometimes required to cover a portion of closing costs, the bulk is paid by the borrower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage closing costs can roughly be divided into five categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lender Fees</li>
<li>Third-Party Fees</li>
<li>Prepaid Items</li>
<li>Escrow Account Funds</li>
<li>Adjustments Related to Your Interest Rate</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s go through each category and break down what items are involved. Think of this as the ultimate guide to mortgage closing costs:</p>
<p><strong>1. Lender Fees:</strong> Fees that the lender charges to process, approve and fund your loan. These fees might change slightly from lender to lender, but typically not by much. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Underwriting: Underwriting is the process by which the lender determines your loan eligibility. This fee covers the lender’s cost for underwriting your loan application.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Government Recording: After originating your mortgage, the lender must then record the mortgage with the applicable government entity (typically the county recorder’s office) in order to protect its collateral interest in your property. This fee covers the lender’s cost of recording your mortgage.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Origination Fee: Usually calculated as a percentage of the loan amount, ranging from 1% to 1.5%. This fee might cover some of lender’s overhead costs plus allow for profit.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Third-Party Fees:</strong> Fees charged by third parties in connection with the processing of your loan. These fees will typically not change (or change very little) from lender to lender.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Appraisal: Regulation requires an appraisal to help the lender assess the true value of a property. The appraisal management company, who chooses the appraiser in accordance with regulation, charges an appraisal fee for their service. Current regulations require lenders to charge exactly what the cost of the appraisal is.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Flood Certification: The lender needs to make sure your property is not located in a flood zone. This fee covers the cost of obtaining a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) indicating whether or not your property is located in a flood zone.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Closing/Settlement: What the title or closing agent charges for managing the closing of your loan on the closing day and making sure that your note and deed are properly filed.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Owner’s Title Insurance: This title insurance policy protects the buyer of a property against financial loss due to title defects or liens. In many states, the property seller typically covers this cost.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Lender’s Title Insurance: This title insurance policy protects the lender against financial loss due to title defects or liens. The borrower typically covers this cost.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Transfer Taxes: This is a tax imposed by the government on the passing of title to property from one person to another. These taxes vary by state and municipality. The cost of transfer taxes is often split between the buyer and the seller, with buyer’s portion being significantly higher.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Prepaid Items:</strong> There are certain items, such as interest and homeowners insurance, that you are required to prepay at closing. These items will not change from lender to lender.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Interest (est. 15 days): The amount of interest that accrues from the date of your loan’s funding to the end of the month when the funding occurred. For example, if your loan was funded on June 10, the prepaid interest should reflect 20 days to cover the period from June 11 to June 30. Since your first mortgage payment on September 1st will cover the interest from August; in order to be all caught up the interest from the month of closing needs to be paid upfront. It is industry best practice to use 15 days as an estimate, since the exact date of your loan closing is still unknown.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Homeowners Insurance (Purchase transactions only): Lenders require that borrowers purchase homeowners insurance, also known as hazard insurance. The lender will require an upfront payment at closing to cover a full year’s premium of homeowners insurance, as required by the policy provider.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Escrow Account Funds:</strong> Lenders require an initial escrow deposit to start your escrow account. Escrow accounts (sometimes referred to as impound accounts) are set up to pay certain property-related expenses, such as property taxes and homeowners insurance. These expenses are usually paid once or twice per year, but your lender will break them down into monthly installments and add them to your mortgage payment each month.</p>
<p>The benefits of an escrow account include slightly lower interest rates and the convenience of having all your property-related expenses lumped into one monthly payment. The reason why you need to “load” that account with some initial funds is that there might not be enough monthly contributions to add up to a balance required to meet tax or insurance obligations. Let’s use the following scenario as an example: your taxes are due in October and are paid semi-annually. Your closing occurs in the middle of June, with a first payment due in August (remember, with mortgage payments you pay for the previous month at the beginning of each month). When October rolls around, the lender should pay half of the annual tax bill, which equals 6 monthly tax escrow payments, yet you’ve only made 3 payments so far. In this case, a lender would ask you to contribute 4 monthly tax payments at the point of loan closing, with 3 payments going towards the deficit and one acting as a buffer in case there is an increase in a tax bill. If you are refinancing and have an escrow account set up with your current lender, you will receive a reimbursement from your current lender with any unused funds available in your current escrow account. Expect a check from your current lender 2-4 weeks after closing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Property Taxes : This is a tax levied by the government where the property is located in order to support local education and resident services such as police and fire protection. The exact amount you’ll need to deposit into your escrow account at closing varies depending on your closing date.</li>
<li>Homeowner&#8217;s Insurance : In addition to the upfront payment at closing to cover a full year’s premium of homeowners insurance (on purchase only), the lender also requires that some funds be deposited into your escrow account at closing to cover your monthly homeowners insurance.</li>
<li>Mortgage Insurance : <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">Mortgage insurance</a> protects the lender from a potential borrower default. It is typically required by the lender when you put less than 20% down to purchase your home or, if you’re refinancing, when your Loan-to-Value if higher than 80%. The lender requires that some funds be deposited into your escrow account at closing to cover your monthly mortgage insurance. We estimate this amount at two months of your monthly mortgage insurance payment.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Adjustments Related to Your Interest Rate:</strong> Depending on the particular <a title="How Are Mortgage Interest Rates Calculated?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-mortgage-interest-rates-calculated/" target="_blank">mortgage rate</a> you choose, you will most likely either receive a borrower credit from the lender (which decreases your total mortgage closing costs) or be required to buy down points (which increase your total mortgage closing costs in exchange for a lower interest rate). If you are unsure which option is better suited for you, one of our mortgage guides can help you weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrower Credit: A credit that may be offered to you by the lender for choosing a particular interest rate. The higher the interest rate, the more borrower credit you will receive from the lender, thereby decreasing your total closing costs.</li>
<li>Buy Down Points: An additional cost that may be added for choosing a particular interest rate. If you want to lower your interest rate even more, you will have to buy down more points, thereby increasing your total closing costs.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">So how much can you expect to pay in total? The rule of thumb is to budget 2-4% of your property price for closing, but that should just be your starting point. Of course, mortgage closing costs will vary by location and property type, but the above is a good estimate of items due at closing. Unfortunately, <a title="Shopping for a Mortgage Online: Why Are Homebuyers Being Misled?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/shopping-for-a-mortgage/" target="_blank">most online mortgage companies</a> will forego showing mortgage closing costs items such as Prepaid Items and Escrow Funds, so make sure you ask twice when you’re given a quote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For a full breakdown and the most accurate estimates of mortgage closing costs you’ll need to pay, use our advanced <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>. We’ve compiled all of the mortgage closing cost items listed above in one easy to use loan details view, so you can easily compare the true cost of each loan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff0000;">WARNING:</span> This post is best suited for finance geeks and normal people who own a home or are looking to buy and hope to better understand mortgage interest rates. You’ve been forewarned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As many of you already know, most lenders are in business to make profits. The way they do so is by charging you interest for the privilege of letting you use their money to buy stuff – whether it’s a new pair of shoes, a car, or a home. The amount of interest you pay is determined by the interest rate the lender charges you. The interest rate the lender charges you, in turn, is heavily influenced by two factors: (1) the general interest rate market, and (2) risk-based pricing (your assessed level of risk as a borrower).<span id="more-437"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The General Interest Rate Market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage rates are more sensitive to market fluctuations than most other loans. See, these days most mortgage loans are sold on the secondary market and securitized into large pools of loans with similar characteristics. These pools of loans, known as Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), are bonds sold to investors and whose prices are determined by market conditions. As the prices of MBSs fluctuate in the market, so do mortgage interest rates. And since no investment is analyzed in a vacuum, because investors have choices when it comes to where they invest their money, MBS prices are heavily influenced by the prices of other bonds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So now let’s take a deeper look into bond pricing&#8230;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bond prices are typically analyzed relative to market benchmarks. These benchmarks tend to be “risk-free” treasuries backed by the U.S. government (and let me tell you, that’s quite some backing). In the case of MBSs, for example, the most commonly-used benchmark is the 10-year Treasury.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, since the majority of bonds are not risk-free (because no entity out there has the credit reputation of good ‘ole Uncle Sam), there are several premiums used in bond pricing to compensate investors for expected and unexpected risks to which investors in “risk-free” investments are not exposed (or at least not to the same extent). These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inflation Premium:</strong> the underlying concept is that your uninvested cash loses its value with every day that passes due to inflation. One dollar today is expected to lose some of its value by tomorrow, and that’s why investors expect to be compensated for the loss of principal caused by inflation (or have you ever heard an investor bragging about just keeping up with inflation?). To make up for that decrease in value due to inflation, investors require a rate of return above and beyond the rate of inflation. Therefore, as the rate of inflation rises, so do market interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Premium:</strong> No, this has nothing to do with water. This addresses the ease of converting a particular investment into cash. The quicker and easier it is to sell the bond, the more liquid it is. Liquidity is determined by the market’s supply and demand forces. If your security is highly desirable, such as highly rated corporate bonds or U.S. Treasury bonds, it is considered to be liquid. Conversely, it might be considerably more difficult to find a buyer for a junk bond, making it less liquid.</li>
<li><strong>Default Risk Premium:</strong> this is connected to the probability of the debt not being repaid by the borrower. On one end of the risk spectrum, we have U.S. treasuries, which are considered to be virtually risk-free because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. On the other end of the risk spectrum, junk bonds carry a high risk of default. The higher the level of default risk, the higher the investor’s required level of compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Prepayment Risk Premium:</strong> this reflects the possibility that an investor may lose future cash flows because a borrower decides to repay the loan (or underlying loan) before the maturity date. In the case of a MBS, for example, an investor’s returns come from your monthly mortgage payment. If you sell your home or refinance the loan, the investor loses the expected cash flow stream associated with your contribution to the MBS pool.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity Risk Premium:</strong> this compensates investors for tying up their money for a long period of time, during which they are exposed to interest rate uncertainty and volatility. Bonds with shorter term maturities have a lower maturity risk premium than ones with long term maturities.</li>

<p dir="ltr">Whew! Ok, so to bring it all back, here’s the short answer to how the market affects the interest rates offered by your lender: fluctuating economic conditions affect the bond markets (including MBSs), which in turn affects the interest rates mortgage lenders offer to the public.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Risk-Based Pricing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The concept behind risk-based pricing is that not every borrower is equal in terms of the risk they present to a lender. Some borrowers are riskier than others, and therefore a lender will adjust the interest rate it offers to a particular borrower based on the lender’s assessment of that borrower’s risk level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A borrower’s credit history is the biggest indicator of risk to a lender. As such, your <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">credit score</a> is the most determinative factor influencing the interest rate you pay on your mortgage. It’s very simple: the higher your credit score, the lower your assessed risk level, and therefore the lower your interest rate. We cannot emphasize enough how important it is to keep track of your credit (but more on that topic later).</p>
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to mortgages, there are several other factors that also affect your interest rate (though not as much as your credit score). Loan-to-Value (LTV) is one of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loan-to-Value is your loan amount divided by the value of the property. If you’re buying a $250,000 home, for example, and you put down $50,000, your resulting loan amount is $200,000, and your LTV, therefore, is 80% (i.e., $200,000 divided by $250,000). To bring it back to the issue of risk, a lower LTV means you have more equity in your home, and therefore present a lower risk of default. As such, the lower your LTV, the lower your interest rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Property type also plays a role in determining your interest rate. Condos, for example, can have slightly higher interest rates than other property types. See, when you buy a condo, you’re buying a unit in a building where the rest of the units are owned by other people. The building’s homeowners’ association relies on HOA dues to maintain the building. If you or the other unit owners can’t pay those dues, the property would not be maintained and the value of the building and the individual units could go down. This presents an additional risk to a lender that is reflected in the interest rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another factor that plays into your interest rate is the loan type. A 15-year fixed, for example, because of its shorter maturity, offers a lower interest rate than a 30-year fixed. Adjustable rate mortgages, well, adjust (or fluctuate) based on market conditions. However, they do typically offer lower initial interest rates than fixed rate mortgages, making them great products for some borrowers (see why <a title="Adjustable Rate Mortgages Are Not Evil" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/adjustable-rate-mortgages-not-evil/" target="_blank">Adjustable Rate Mortgages are not evil</a>, they’re just not for everyone).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your intended use of the property also affects your loan’s interest rate. For example, the interest rate you pay to buy an investment property is higher than what you pay to buy a primary home. Buyers are less likely to default on their primary home than on an investment property, therefore making them a lower risk for the lender.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, there are certain factors a lender may NOT use to adjust the interest rate they offer you. These are factors <a title="You Could Be Denied A Loan Just For Being Gay" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/denied-loan-just-for-being-gay/" target="_blank">protected by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> (ECOA); they are: race, color, religion, national origin, sex (gender), marital status, age (if the applicant is old enough to enter into a contract), or receipt of income from a public assistance program. Your rate is also unaffected if you&#8217;re a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a>. Adjusting your interest rate based on any of these factors would constitute discrimination, and, as you may know, that’s a big no-no.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that everything is, I’m sure, clear as mud as to how mortgage interest rates are determined, let us know if you have any questions or comments.
