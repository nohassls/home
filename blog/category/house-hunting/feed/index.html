				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Ramon Robinson</em></p>
<p>It’s not an overstatement to say that AirBnB and Couchsurfing have been major forces behind some of my biggest life developments. Two years ago, I embarked upon a 108-day journey to build a global network of friends from those home sharing sites. The itinerary, which led to a doubling of my Facebook friends total, looked like this:<span id="more-542"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1859" src="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing-2.png" alt="mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing-2" width="950" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Since then, my goals have changed quite a bit. I’ve been writing for <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">MortgageHippo</a> – a company that, much like these home sharing sites are doing with renting and lodging, wants to simplify and improve the home-buying process through technology. Most of the people with whom I work are also in their early 30s, and even though they’re passionate about travel, they recognize the importance of a solid home to which to return from backpacking expeditions. In conversation with them, I couldn’t help but wonder: What do I want in a home, and how do I reconcile my passion for traveling a lot with my desire for a home I can really call my own?</p>
<p>To answer that question, I decided to go home sharing abroad again with this itinerary:</p>
<p><a href="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing_itne2013-2014.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1860" src="https://d2rmzbkg9hch64.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing_itne2013-2014.png" alt="mortgagehippo_post_airbnb_couchsurfing_itne2013-2014" width="950" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>It would be the stickiest of bubblegum stretches to say that I returned to Chicago with a firm sense of place in the world, confident in my vision of my future as a head of household, with hands tightly clasping the financial, intellectual and social capital required to realize that vision. What has instead materialized from conversations with my AirBnB and Couchsurfing hosts, recent and distant past, is this little guide to exploiting home sharing sites to gain clarity about the right home for oneself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 1<br />
When you find yourself home sharing in a part of the world that’s amenable to your long-term interests, seriously consider just living there. If your hosts are good personality matches, they may even agree to let you stay with them until you can reestablish yourself in the new city or country</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just the stuff of fiction: Even in “this economy,” people who may have several decades of life ahead of them are quitting their jobs, renting their apartments out, and even selling their homes to couchsurf while traveling. Their time spent test driving homes and lifestyles around the world lasts anywhere from months to years, often thanks to the advent of these free home sharing sites.</p>
<p>Short-term home sharing – the kind that doesn’t require completely dispensing with your safety net – can yield revelations about the ideal place to invest in a home too: During my second stay in Macedonia this past spring, my friend Emilija Damjanovic – a costume jeweler in the capital city of Skopje – remarked that her interactions with American couchsurfers like me made her grateful to live in a country where it’s normal to continue living with ones parents well into adulthood. “What I hear about the U.S. is that even with a good salary, you have a hard time finding a new home that does not come with big problems,” she said over a multi-course lunch not costing more than $5 USD total for the two of us. “The living conditions in New York and San Francisco just sound disgusting to me. Here, I have a large room of my own and feel no shame about living with my parents at 40, since many other adult Macedonians live with their parents too.”</p>
<p>Can you imagine how much money Americans could save, and how amazing the homes we’d ultimately build for ourselves would be, if there weren’t a cultural imperative to have our own places before we’re financially established? One way of fighting that imperative, or any other that ails you, would be to relocate where it doesn’t exist. Home sharing while you’re gathering your bearings would make that a much less expensive proposition than it might otherwise be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 2<br />
It might be okay to think small. Beyond traditional homes and apartments, home sharing sites offer hippie bus, tiny house and tree house stays. Stay overnight in the most sustainable of the three living options – the tiny houses. </strong></p>
<p>AirBnB has been a godsend – a sort of fairy godmother-send, to be precise – for my childhood friend Klara. Beyond permitting her access to most of the amenities of a private hotel suite at prices within her SF Bay Area librarian’s budget, it also allows her to play house at the ripe old age of thirty. She always books places to stay without a host present for this reason: “It’s much easier to pretend I live there if the actual owner isn’t wandering around.”</p>
<p>The good news for Klara and all you other domestic bliss dreamers out there is that there are fully-appointed, owner personality-infused rentals where you can play house for a while, even in a community of other whimsical types also playing house. Then if you decide that they should be your real homes, you can buy them furnished as they were when you were a guest in them. I read about these toy-to-true abodes in The New Yorker before I began spotting them in places like rural Louisiana, the English countryside, and even along the railways of Eastern Europe this past trip. They’re called TINY HOUSES: Low impact, multipurpose, portable living units that are exactly what their name suggests. For those listed on AirBnB, the owner is often present in a nearby big house for guidance on tiny house living. House hunting fans of the 1939 Judy Garland film The Wizard of Oz will be giddy upon hearing that one tiny house currently available for rent through the site is even shaped like a mushroom, while another was constructed from mushrooms. In other words: Welcome to sustainable Munchkinland, folks, and make yourself at home!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 3<br />
If you happen to move from one bad home sharing experience to another, keep a healthy perspective: You can learn a lot about what you want in a home even by comparing an undesirable option to a more undesirable option.</strong></p>
<p>If there’s one thing that has left me in awe of even the modest homes where I’ve stayed on travels, it’s my memory of the shadiest ones where I’ve stayed both as a resident and as a traveler.</p>
<p>As a graduate student visiting New Orleans for my 29th birthday: I booked a place described as a “stylish, comfortable and functional room” in a “peaceful and serene neighborhood” just “a short walk to the Legendary French Quarter.” The quality of the room was understated: With its gold, yellow and black trimmings, Mardis Gras wall masks, and books recalling the city’s history, the room was so inviting that I often didn’t leave it for sightseeing until early afternoon. Unfortunately, I discovered on a casual stroll recommended by my hosts that the neighborhood only appeared serene because its residents preferred to remain locked inside. Nightly police sirens from all compass angles signaled that I’d better run back to the house if I couldn’t hail a taxi along the way. “What the hell do you mean ‘it doesn’t seem safe’?,” one of my hosts would say as I’d rush inside after desperately fumbling with the keys to unlock the front door. “Hurricane Katrina turned this into one of the safest neighborhoods in the city.” This host bore a diagonal knife wound from his left ear to his right cheek, courtesy of a man he’d killed in combat during the Gulf War, and the most conspicuous manifestation of his PTSD was his habit of building traps for roosters in the B&amp;B’s yard and axing them into mattress and meat pie filling for fun before brushing his teeth in the morning.</p>
<p>Such cringe-worthy experiences informed my appreciation for my most recent AirBnB – one that some call haunted while others, including me, call it charming. It’s located in the Scottish town of Dumfries, otherwise known as the gateway to the site of the 1988 Lockerbie air disaster. My Dumfries hosts were imbued with a sort of controlled jolliness – as if they were only allowing themselves to appear tipsy enough for legitimate Scotsman-ship, despite possessing the permanent internal sobriety common among survivors of a mass tragedy. The house suggested the same paradox: Fluffy red velvet curtains and bedspreads contrasted by narrow stained glass windows, and a rather dimly lit den where the host’s children were encouraged to ride tricycles in small circles ad infinitum. It wasn’t the prettiest picture of home and family, but I’d look for inspiration in a home suggesting peaceful resignation any day over ones asking me to rest on high alert.</p>
<p>With that in mind, as you’re investigating homes, just remember this: You might learn even more about what you need in a house by comparing bad ones to better ones than you would by projecting yourself into a rental so splendid that it feels at odds with your true persona.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 4<br />
The person or people with whom you can share a mortgage, and a lifetime, may be awaiting you at an AirBnB or Couchsurfing home.</strong></p>
<p>Officially, you’re in violation of Couchsurfing.org policies if you use the website as a dating or hookup application. That said, love knows no e-bounds, and I’ve met people who found their husbands, wives and home co-investors through home sharing sites. It makes good sense: Home sharing sites encourage people to profile their homes and interests so that they can be matched with people who share those interests and would like to spend at least one night in those homes.</p>
<p>The story of Alexis and Kyle Kleinbeck illustrates at least three ways to approach this step: The couple introduced themselves to one another at a meet-up for Couchsurfers in Cincinatti, Ohio. Sidestepping any obligations to the invisible Big Brother figures at Couchsurfing.org, they allowed their flame to kindle and decided to marry in Autumn 2013. At their wedding in Wisconsin, guests from as far as Alaska and India – including other Couchsurfers – were invited to camp out in the backyard of Kyle’s mom’s house in Wisconsin for a whole weekend. The gathering was an enormous hit, and the Kleinbecks later used their wedding party in combination with Couchsurfers they met as husband and wife to build an international living community. Now that they have a strong network of friends and wedding guests around the world, they can probably generate a substantial amount of funding for any home and lifestyle initiatives they have in mind should they ever want to do that. As a recent Forbes article suggests, the Kleinbecks could even crowd-finance a home using donations from their personal Couchsurfing community on websites like Crowd Estates and Indiegogo.</p>
<p>The three major takeaways here are: 1) Built-in crowdfunding circles 2) Members passionate about communal living scenarios in which dozens of people split the household bills and 3) Wealthy spouse and benefactor prospects. Could home sharing sites be a quick-fix for the lonely and loveless? That may just be the hot topic for my next trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 5<br />
You can use home sharing sites to pay your mortgage. Maybe.</strong></p>
<p>Using AirBnB to pay ones mortgage and avoid being tied to a traditional job is something of a phenomenon: One couple made nearly $349 between four guests sleeping in their living room over a single night. Another couple are prepared to describe themselves on LinkedIn as an AirBnB Real Estate Tycoons. My New Orleans host retired from the military in middle age to make a living renting out rooms in his home on AirBnB, and despite the revelation that his neighborhood is The ‘Hood, he seems to be living well off his profits. And, surprise, surprise: A “<a href="http://www.lulu.com/ca/en/shop/stephen-liddell/how-to-get-rich-using-airbnb/ebook/product-21175161.html" target="_blank">Get Rich Quick Using AirBnB</a>” self-help book is in online circulation now.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, there are legal issues associated with home sharing rentals in some states: Some leasers have been evicted for renting out rooms in their apartments on AirBnB. Others have found that they have no legal recourse when guests damage their property. And in a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-host-cant-get-squatter-to-leave-2014-7" target="_blank">news item</a> that has gone viral, one AirBnB host in Palm Springs, Cory Tschogl, is currently being sued by a guest squatting in her property. The reason for this is that in California, if someone rents a room for over 30 days, he becomes a tenant and can only be evicted through the traditional three to six month process requiring up to $5,000 in legal fees. Those are some of the reasons why I can’t blindly recommend AirBnB and other paid home stay arrangements as a means of paying off your mortgage.</p>
<p>However, if you can iron out the details of a host-guest agreement in advance of any stays so that you’re covered legally, you may never have to think about foreclosure again. That’s something I plan to keep in mind for the home of my unforeseeable future.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lesson 6<br />
Don’t just show guests their rooms and vanish for the remainder of their stays all the time. Host too!</strong></p>
<p>Settled into the right home? Then host in it! Once you&#8217;ve caught the home sharing bug, &#8216;home sweet home&#8217; will always be sweeter with more people in it.</p>
<p>And to get you there along the path of least resistance, here’s an ideal itinerary you can follow to get the house of your dreams. Click on the map below to start your journey:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a reader of <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog" target="_blank">The Jungle Journal</a>, you most likely know that Trulia, Redfin, and Zillow are not the names of aliens from another planet, but among an ever-growing list of websites that help buyers locate homes and the corresponding seller’s information.</p>
<p>Also, as a reader of this blog, you know that Morty is a hippo-sized fan of online tools and <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculators</a> that help home buyers take control of their home-buying experience. Anyone looking for a home can find available properties in their desired areas with a few clicks of a button. So, with so many websites to locate homes for sale, should home buyers still use a real estate agent to find their perfect home?</p>
<p>When considering such an important decision, consider the big three – and I’m not talking about LeBron, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. I am talking about Expertise, Power, and Money.<span id="more-398"></span></p>
<h2>Expertise</h2>
<p>Purchasing a home is a complex transaction. Due to its complexity, many different professionals get involved along the way: MortgageHippo for your mortgage and <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a> tools, a real estate attorney for your purchase contract, a home inspector, an appraiser, a title company, etc.</p>
<p>You may think of a real estate agent as a member of this group that is only in charge of finding you a property (which you also think is within your Google reach without an agent). You are partly right &#8211; a real estate agent should save your finger a lot of scrolling through properties on your iPhone, but that’s not the whole story. The agent should also play an integral role as quarterback among these many different professionals, which is no small task.</p>
<p>A real estate agent should be your expert and here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can educate you on refining what property you are looking for and how much it will cost.</li>
<li>They can sort through active listings of property (through the Multiple Listing Service) in your desired neighborhoods and their relevant market conditions, including how long they have been on the market. While you can do much of this searching online, you may be relying on half-truths and expired information and not even realize it.</li>
<li>They should counsel/advise you through inspections and any needed repairs.</li>
<li>They can help answer any questions on the entire <a title="What to Expect from the Mortgage Process" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/what_to_expect" target="_blank">mortgage process</a> and usual mounds of paperwork.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can navigate this expertise on your own; however, it will not be as easy as a few internet searches may lead you to think. If this is your first time buying a home, work with experts!</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, in order to get your dream home, you will be relying on others along the way. As a result, you may not always feel in power. Working without an agent certainly increases your involvement in the process, but the right agent should increase your power in the transaction. Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Seller and their agent may take you more seriously;</li>
<li>Your agent will negotiate on your behalf</li>
</ol>
<p>The seller and their agent will most likely take you seriously with or without an agent <b>IF</b> you have secured financing, have all of your paperwork in order, and show experience with the home buying process. You most likely do not have the level of familiarity with the process to give confidence to the seller that you are a legitimate buyer, and that’s not good.</p>
<p>If the seller and their agent do not have confidence in you, they will either not sell you the property because of the risk of it falling through or sell you the property at a higher than market price, taking advantage of your lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>Enter the buyer’s real estate agent.</p>
<p>The real estate agent gives you more power in the transaction because you have a professional representing you and negotiating on your behalf. This is hugely important because any leg up in negotiation is a good thing. The real estate agent has a fiduciary responsibility (legal responsibility) to represent your best interests in the transaction. However, to help keep some control of your buying process, be sure to continue to educate yourself and keep in touch with all aspects of the process along the way.</p>
<p>Since the sellers are likely using their own agent, you want to avoid their agent taking over the entire process. If you enter the transaction and the ensuing negotiation without an agent, the seller’s agent may ask you if he/she can represent you and the seller in a dual agency role. This allows him/her to keep a larger commission.</p>
<p>But how can a seller’s real estate agent that is supposed to be representing the best interests of the seller also be your agent and represent your best interests? We don’t think it&#8217;s possible and that’s why we advise against it.</p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>Money, money, money. Without a real estate agent, you may save money. This is awesome – clearly. But to do so, you must ask the right questions and know what you are doing.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of home sales, the buyer’s agent splits a commission (ranging from 5% to 7%) with the seller’s agent. The seller, out of purchase price, pays the commission. The buyer’s agent does not receive their payment until after your <a title="Morty’s House-Hunting Tips and Essentials" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortys-house-hunting-tips-essentials/" target="_blank">house-hunting</a> is over, the contract is negotiated, and the sale is complete. While this does not seem to be a cost to you, most sellers will price this anticipated cost into the purchase price, and therefore, you are participating in the payment, albeit indirectly.</p>
<p>If you do not have a real estate agent representing you, be sure to ask that a lower commission percentage be set and that you would like the purchase price to be lowered to reflect this. Since the seller often sets the commission percentage, without the buyer developing a relationship with the seller, the seller will not necessarily know to lower the commission. If the seller does not know to lower the commission, they will most likely maintain the original larger commission that was meant to be split with the buyer’s agent.</p>
<p>Without a reduction in the commission percentage to reflect that there is no buyer’s agent, you will not save money. And if there is no money savings, then you should definitely use a buyer’s agent because you will be paying for it!</p>
<p>If you do choose to use a real estate agent, keep an eye on their recommendations for the right purchase price and the <a title="When is the right time to buy a home?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-is-the-right-time-to-buy-a-home/" target="_blank">right time to buy your home</a>. They know the marketplace – which is needed intel.</p>
<p>Earlier, we stated that they have a legal responsibility to represent your best interests, but remember, the real estate agent gets paid when the transaction in complete. So, the longer the transaction takes, the longer the agent works without payment. The wonderful University of Chicago minds behind <i>Freakonomics</i>, so perfectly show how this incentive to get paid as soon as possible may push agents that represent the seller to sell at a lower price than the seller could achieve by waiting longer. The same philosophy can be applied to buyer’s agents that push the buyer to offer a higher price earlier so that the transaction can be finished earlier and they can get paid.</p>
<p>Take a look at the authors of <a title="Freakonomics: Real Estate Agent Commissions" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFYlgqv3T-w" target="_blank"><i>Freakonomics’ </i>depiction of this</a>.</p>
<h2>Morty’s Two Cents</h2>
<p>There are a number of great reasons to use a real estate agent, and Morty recommends finding a great agent and utilizing their expertise and power. Of course, Morty is always available through an email or a quick phone call to offer you recommendations for agents in your area.</p>
<p>Whether or not you choose to work with an agent, do your own research on available homes, experts, and the purchase process.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During this home buying season, make sure your dream of homeownership doesn&#8217;t turn into a nightmare by avoiding these three very common home buying pitfalls.<span id="more-387"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Buying more home than you can afford</h2>
<p dir="ltr">But if you get approved for a loan of a certain size you must be able to afford it, right? Not so quick my friend. See, when you get approved for a loan amount, you’re typically approved based on your Debt-to-Income ratio: your monthly debts divided by your gross monthly income. The problem with this calculation is that monthly debt does not paint a full picture of your lifestyle. It doesn’t include your weekend trips to Vegas, your yearly vacation to the French Riviera, your daily $3+ Starbucks coffee, your $400 leather shoes, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The list goes on and on, but you get the point. People’s lifestyles are very different, and credit reports used by mortgage companies don’t necessarily capture that (unless you’re paying for your lavish lifestyle with credit cards, in which case you may not qualify for a loan at all). It’s up to you to be responsible and honest with yourself about <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">how much home you can afford</a> and not just let mortgage guidelines determine that for you.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Rushing yourself through the home shopping process</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Finding the right home takes time. Don’t rush it. Don’t let your excitement take a hold of you to the point where you end up making a rash decision. <a title="Morty’s House-Hunting Tips and Essentials" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortys-house-hunting-tips-essentials/" target="_blank">Shopping for a home</a> is a lot of fun, but it’s also serious business. The following are just a few recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Write down a list of certain home features your new home must absolutely have or it’s a deal breaker (e.g. two bathrooms, a nice, open kitchen, etc.). This will keep you focused and keep you from falling in love with a home that doesn’t really meet your needs.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">When you find a home you like, make sure to visit it several times on several days of the week and at different times during the day. A home can look and feel very different on a calm and sunny Sunday afternoon than on a hectic and rainy Monday night.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If at all possible, get a home inspection (sometimes an inspection is required anyway). Avoid surprises and know exactly what you’re getting into. An inspection can also help you negotiate more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Keep a home buying journal. Write an entry every time you visit a home. What did you like? What didn’t you like? This will help you narrow down your list of finalists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not getting the right home loan for your needs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This is a big one.  Getting a mortgage that fits your needs can save you a lot of money and headache in the long run. Let me walk you through a quick example that illustrates this point very clearly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s say Luigi is buying his first home, and he expects to stay in that home for no longer than five years. In fact, he’s absolutely, 110%, super duper extra sure that he’ll sell the home the day before his fifth year anniversary of buying it. If this is the case, then a 5-year <a title="Adjustable Rate Mortgages Are Not Evil" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/adjustable-rate-mortgages-not-evil/" target="_blank">adjustable rate mortgage</a> (ARM) is the perfect loan for Luigi. He will never be exposed to the potential interest rate fluctuation of the loan, and he will enjoy its lower interest rate and lower monthly payment for five years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But no one is 100% certain about anything, so how can Luigi be so sure he’ll only stay in his home five years minus one day? Well, Luigi is a fictional superhero, and you’re right: us common folk don’t have those amazing powers. This is why an adjustable rate mortgage is not for everyone. There is an inherent risk with this product: if you stay longer than you expected, you may be exposed to interest rate fluctuations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Buying a home is one of the most thrilling experiences this purple hippo has ever had: a mixture of anxiety and excitement, especially for <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time homebuyers</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s a big deal – this is where you sleep at night, where you have dinner with your family, and where you’ll have your friends over for a bbq or to watch the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your home is your castle (even if it doesn’t look like one); it’s where you get to set the rules without anyone telling you what to do&#8230; except maybe your spouse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s our advice: enjoy every second of the home buying experience and don’t let the <a title="What to Expect" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/what_to_expect" target="_blank">mortgage process</a> – which can sometimes be overwhelming – ruin it for you.<span id="more-1960"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">To help out, we’ve put together a short list of tips to help you maximize your house-hunting experience – a “house-hunting essentials” if you may.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">House Hunting Tip #1: Determine how much you can you afford</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Always start the process by asking yourself <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">how much home you can afford</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s amazing how many people start the home buying process having no clue what price range they should aim for. Cruising around fancy neighborhoods looking at beautiful homes is fun, but you have to be realistic and disciplined about this or you’ll end up wasting a lot of your own time and that of others who are helping you along the way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plus, if you want to be taken seriously by sellers and real estate agents, you’ll want to <a title="Mortgage Pre-Approval Interview" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/interview" target="_blank">get pre-approved for a mortgage</a> loan by a mortgage professional.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are lots of tools out there to help you determine how much home you can afford. At <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a>, we’ve built an awesome <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> and tool to walk you through the entire mortgage process step-by-step, helping you figure out these things as you go.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">House Hunting Tip #2: Narrow down your home search</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Knowing how much home you can afford will help you narrow down your search, but asking yourself some other useful questions will help focus your search even more:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How many bedrooms and bathrooms do I need?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What type of property best fits me (e.g. detached, townhome, condo, etc.)? If it’s a condo, for example, are you looking for certain amenities?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Do you have kids? Are you planning on having kids soon? How much do you care about living in a quiet, residential neighborhood with good schools and nice parks?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Or do you want to be in the hustle and bustle of the big city, where you’re walking distance to a nice restaurant, the dry cleaners, the theater, etc?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">You probably already have an idea of what you want, but the more you narrow down your search, the more time you’ll save looking at properties. Prepare this wish-list ahead of time, and make sure to plan with whoever you&#8217;ll be living with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your real estate agent will also thank you for this, which brings us to our next tip.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">House Hunting Tip #3: Work with a good real estate agent</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A good <a title="When Should You Use a Real Estate Agent to Buy a Home?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-should-you-use-a-real-estate-agent-to-buy-a-home/" target="_blank">real estate agent</a> will add a lot of value to your home buying experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They tend to know their city (or at least the areas where they do most of their business) better than almost anyone out there and can recommend neighborhoods and even specific streets that would be a good fit for you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When the time comes to make an offer, they can help you negotiate with the seller.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, as a buyer, you don’t have to pay a real estate agent out of pocket; they get a commission from the seller. Schwing!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">House Hunting Tip #4: Keep track of the homes you visit</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With all the amazing technology we have on hand (literally), it’s very easy to keep a simple journal of all the properties you visit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take pictures of the homes and take notes as you visit them. Record your first impression of every property: how did you feel when you first walked in?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Combine this journal with a quick checklist: In-unit washer/dryer? Check. Parking garage? Check.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t rely on your memory. You’ll likely be seeing lots of homes, and it’s very easy to get them confused.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">House Hunting Tip #5: Visit the property multiple times before making an offer</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This doesn’t have to be a long process, but make sure to visit a property multiple times and at different times of the day. A property can seem very different during the day than at night, or even very different during the week than during the weekend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At night, a house may be very well lit (by artificial lighting that is), but what about during the day? Will you have to keep those lights on too? Is there no natural light?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Noise levels can also be very different during the day than at night. You don&#8217;t want to find out your home rumbles all day because of the day train if you only visited the property at night leading up to the purchase.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At <a title="MortgageHippo" href="/">MortgageHippo</a> we’re all about having fun and making the mortgage process as enjoyable as possible for you, but making the initial decision to buy a home is some serious business. So when is the right time to buy a home?</p>
<p>The short answer is: whenever you’re ready for it! Let me explain.<span id="more-22"></span></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the typical mortgage “expert” has a pre-prepared piece of advice: “Make sure you take advantage of these low interest rates and affordable home prices! They’re only going to go up in your area!”</p>
<p>Hmmm… maybe, but interest rates and home prices are not the only factors to consider when making your decision. In fact, interest rates and home prices are only useful toward answering the most important question: “<a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">How much home can I afford?</a>”</p>
<p>Here are some other factors you should take into account before taking the plunge:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a> requirements?</li>
<li>How much will the <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">closing costs</a> amount to?</li>
<li>What can I expect to spend on home maintenance?</li>
<li>How long do I expect to stay in this home?</li>
</ol>
<p>Nowadays most conventional loan programs require <i>at least</i> a 5% down payment, so make sure you’ve saved enough money for this initial investment—preferably more.  With respect to closing costs, you can expect to pay anywhere between 3% and 5% of the loan amount. Maintenance costs will vary significantly depending on the type of home you buy (a condo, for example, is generally cheaper to maintain than a house), but a <a href="http://www.mint.com/blog/goals/home-repair-02022011/">suggested rule of thumb</a> is 1%-2% of the home purchase price per year.</p>
<p>Finally, the one factor that is often overlooked is your expectation of how long you plan on staying in the home you’ve set your eyes on.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because selling your home has a cost — mainly the cost of paying a real estate agent to sell the house for you, which is typically around 5% of the price of the home. Add in moving costs and you can see how expenses could easily rack up and surprise you.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a quick example to illustrate these costs:</p>
<p>Doug is a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a> looking to buy a $200,000 home with 5% down and closing costs of 4%. In this case, Doug’s required out-of-pocket expenses add up to <b>$17,600</b> ($10,000 down payment plus $7,600 in closing costs).  At an interest rate of 4%, his monthly payment on a 30-year fixed home loan (including principal, interest, property taxes, and insurance) would be approximately <b>$1,300 per month</b>.</p>
<p>Now let’s assume Doug sells his home in 3 years for $220,000 and pays a 5% commission to his real estate agent.  That commission comes out to <b>$11,250</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly summarize what he paid over those 3 years:</p>
<ol>
<li>$46,800 in total monthly payments ($1,300 * 36)</li>
<li>$17,600 in upfront expenses</li>
<li>$11,250 commission to his <a title="When Should You Use a Real Estate Agent to Buy a Home?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-should-you-use-a-real-estate-agent-to-buy-a-home/" target="_blank">real estate agent</a> for selling the home.</li>
</ol>
<p>This comes out to a grand total of $75,650.  After taking into account the $8,750 he made from selling the home, the total paid over those 3 years was $66,900, or approximately <b>$1,860 per month</b>.</p>
<p>Now the question you should ask yourself is what the cost of the alternative to buying a home would have been during those 3 years. Most likely the alternative would have been renting. If his rent had been higher than $1,860 per month by a wide enough margin, then he probably would have been better off buying during that time than renting (this assumes nothing about the sanity of any hypothetical landlord).</p>
<p>The point is, buying a home is a great thing, but it’s also an important decision that requires some serious thought…even a little math. In general, the longer you expect to stay in a home, the more it makes sense to buy than to rent. Try running the numbers using a good <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> and compare for yourself.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b></p>
