				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff0000;">WARNING:</span> This post is best suited for finance geeks and normal people who own a home or are looking to buy and hope to better understand mortgage interest rates. You’ve been forewarned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As many of you already know, most lenders are in business to make profits. The way they do so is by charging you interest for the privilege of letting you use their money to buy stuff – whether it’s a new pair of shoes, a car, or a home. The amount of interest you pay is determined by the interest rate the lender charges you. The interest rate the lender charges you, in turn, is heavily influenced by two factors: (1) the general interest rate market, and (2) risk-based pricing (your assessed level of risk as a borrower).<span id="more-437"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The General Interest Rate Market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage rates are more sensitive to market fluctuations than most other loans. See, these days most mortgage loans are sold on the secondary market and securitized into large pools of loans with similar characteristics. These pools of loans, known as Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), are bonds sold to investors and whose prices are determined by market conditions. As the prices of MBSs fluctuate in the market, so do mortgage interest rates. And since no investment is analyzed in a vacuum, because investors have choices when it comes to where they invest their money, MBS prices are heavily influenced by the prices of other bonds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So now let’s take a deeper look into bond pricing&#8230;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bond prices are typically analyzed relative to market benchmarks. These benchmarks tend to be “risk-free” treasuries backed by the U.S. government (and let me tell you, that’s quite some backing). In the case of MBSs, for example, the most commonly-used benchmark is the 10-year Treasury.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, since the majority of bonds are not risk-free (because no entity out there has the credit reputation of good ‘ole Uncle Sam), there are several premiums used in bond pricing to compensate investors for expected and unexpected risks to which investors in “risk-free” investments are not exposed (or at least not to the same extent). These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inflation Premium:</strong> the underlying concept is that your uninvested cash loses its value with every day that passes due to inflation. One dollar today is expected to lose some of its value by tomorrow, and that’s why investors expect to be compensated for the loss of principal caused by inflation (or have you ever heard an investor bragging about just keeping up with inflation?). To make up for that decrease in value due to inflation, investors require a rate of return above and beyond the rate of inflation. Therefore, as the rate of inflation rises, so do market interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Premium:</strong> No, this has nothing to do with water. This addresses the ease of converting a particular investment into cash. The quicker and easier it is to sell the bond, the more liquid it is. Liquidity is determined by the market’s supply and demand forces. If your security is highly desirable, such as highly rated corporate bonds or U.S. Treasury bonds, it is considered to be liquid. Conversely, it might be considerably more difficult to find a buyer for a junk bond, making it less liquid.</li>
<li><strong>Default Risk Premium:</strong> this is connected to the probability of the debt not being repaid by the borrower. On one end of the risk spectrum, we have U.S. treasuries, which are considered to be virtually risk-free because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. On the other end of the risk spectrum, junk bonds carry a high risk of default. The higher the level of default risk, the higher the investor’s required level of compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Prepayment Risk Premium:</strong> this reflects the possibility that an investor may lose future cash flows because a borrower decides to repay the loan (or underlying loan) before the maturity date. In the case of a MBS, for example, an investor’s returns come from your monthly mortgage payment. If you sell your home or refinance the loan, the investor loses the expected cash flow stream associated with your contribution to the MBS pool.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity Risk Premium:</strong> this compensates investors for tying up their money for a long period of time, during which they are exposed to interest rate uncertainty and volatility. Bonds with shorter term maturities have a lower maturity risk premium than ones with long term maturities.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Whew! Ok, so to bring it all back, here’s the short answer to how the market affects the interest rates offered by your lender: fluctuating economic conditions affect the bond markets (including MBSs), which in turn affects the interest rates mortgage lenders offer to the public.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Risk-Based Pricing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The concept behind risk-based pricing is that not every borrower is equal in terms of the risk they present to a lender. Some borrowers are riskier than others, and therefore a lender will adjust the interest rate it offers to a particular borrower based on the lender’s assessment of that borrower’s risk level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A borrower’s credit history is the biggest indicator of risk to a lender. As such, your <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">credit score</a> is the most determinative factor influencing the interest rate you pay on your mortgage. It’s very simple: the higher your credit score, the lower your assessed risk level, and therefore the lower your interest rate. We cannot emphasize enough how important it is to keep track of your credit (but more on that topic later).</p>
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to mortgages, there are several other factors that also affect your interest rate (though not as much as your credit score). Loan-to-Value (LTV) is one of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loan-to-Value is your loan amount divided by the value of the property. If you’re buying a $250,000 home, for example, and you put down $50,000, your resulting loan amount is $200,000, and your LTV, therefore, is 80% (i.e., $200,000 divided by $250,000). To bring it back to the issue of risk, a lower LTV means you have more equity in your home, and therefore present a lower risk of default. As such, the lower your LTV, the lower your interest rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Property type also plays a role in determining your interest rate. Condos, for example, can have slightly higher interest rates than other property types. See, when you buy a condo, you’re buying a unit in a building where the rest of the units are owned by other people. The building’s homeowners’ association relies on HOA dues to maintain the building. If you or the other unit owners can’t pay those dues, the property would not be maintained and the value of the building and the individual units could go down. This presents an additional risk to a lender that is reflected in the interest rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another factor that plays into your interest rate is the loan type. A 15-year fixed, for example, because of its shorter maturity, offers a lower interest rate than a 30-year fixed. Adjustable rate mortgages, well, adjust (or fluctuate) based on market conditions. However, they do typically offer lower initial interest rates than fixed rate mortgages, making them great products for some borrowers (see why <a title="Adjustable Rate Mortgages Are Not Evil" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/adjustable-rate-mortgages-not-evil/" target="_blank">Adjustable Rate Mortgages are not evil</a>, they’re just not for everyone).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your intended use of the property also affects your loan’s interest rate. For example, the interest rate you pay to buy an investment property is higher than what you pay to buy a primary home. Buyers are less likely to default on their primary home than on an investment property, therefore making them a lower risk for the lender.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, there are certain factors a lender may NOT use to adjust the interest rate they offer you. These are factors <a title="You Could Be Denied A Loan Just For Being Gay" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/denied-loan-just-for-being-gay/" target="_blank">protected by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> (ECOA); they are: race, color, religion, national origin, sex (gender), marital status, age (if the applicant is old enough to enter into a contract), or receipt of income from a public assistance program. Your rate is also unaffected if you&#8217;re a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a>. Adjusting your interest rate based on any of these factors would constitute discrimination, and, as you may know, that’s a big no-no.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that everything is, I’m sure, clear as mud as to how mortgage interest rates are determined, let us know if you have any questions or comments. Just kidding, hopefully this was very useful and not too difficult to digest, but please do drop off any questions or comments below.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prior to the 1970s, lenders would commonly engage in a discriminatory practice known as “income discounting”: when the income of a woman applying for credit would be devalued by a lender based on the expectation that her income was not stable because she was unlikely to remain in the workforce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result of this type of gender discrimination, Congress passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) in 1974 to prohibit discrimination against applicants for credit “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract)” or “because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">So why – over 40 years later – are we bringing up again the issue of gender discrimination when the reality is that we have made great advances since those days to protect women and other groups who have been historically discriminated against?<span id="more-416"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, do you notice any one group missing from the extensive list of ECOA protected classes? That’s right, sexual orientation is not a protected class under ECOA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, there is no federal law that protects applicants for credit from being discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation. Several states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to protect the LGBT community from discriminatory practices, but there is nothing yet at the Federal level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So now consider this scenario:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mark and John walk into their local community bank. They are <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a> looking to get a mortgage to buy together. They both have <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">excellent credit scores</a> and stable incomes that allow them to comfortably qualify for the loan together. During casual conversation, the loan officer picks up on the fact that Mark and John are a gay couple. The loan officer believes that homosexuality is a sin and refuses to help them with their mortgage application. If Mark and John are in a State that does not offer state-level protection against credit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, they may have no recourse under our judicial system against this loan officer and his company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How does this blatant act of injustice make you feel? Is this really an issue we want to leave to the individual States to resolve?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The basic premise of our country –masterfully stated in our Declaration of Independence – is that all of us are “endowed” with certain “inalienable rights” and that “among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” How can we guarantee an individual’s inalienable right to the “pursuit of Happiness” when we allow a loan officer to reject a loan applicant for being gay?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, we invite all of you to stand behind an effort to amend ECOA to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes: the Freedom from Discrimination in Credit Act (FDCA). FDCA simply extends the basic protections afforded under ECOA to members of our LGBT community. It was introduced to Congress on June 13, 2013.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To learn more about FDCA, check out this <a href="http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/freedom-from-discrimination-in-credit-act">Human Rights Campaign resource</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Having you mortgage sold to another bank or company is not the end of the world. In fact, it is a very common thing. Say you just survived the mortgage jungle and are celebrating in your new home. It took you five minutes and ten exclamation points to send out your new home address to all of your friends and family.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now… you are sitting on your brand new couch, waiting for all of your housewarming presents, but the first delivery in the mail isn’t a blender or a photo of your weird aunt and her cats. Nope, it’s a letter regarding your mortgage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The letter is from someone named Fannie Mae, and reads “Notification of Assignment, Sale, or Transfer of Your Mortgage Loan”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your first thought: “What the $%@? Who is Fannie Mae?” Your second thought: “What does this mean for my mortgage and my new home?”<span id="more-270"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">My mortgage was sold?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Even though you spent time and care preparing your mortgage application for a specific lender (and if you didn’t use <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo.com</a>, it was most likely a painful process), there’s a very high likelihood that your mortgage was sold to another company after closing on your home. Welcome to the vibrant, fast moving economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, this should neither surprise nor concern you for two reasons:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. The mortgage provider was required under federal law to disclose to you during the <a title="What to Expect" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/what_to_expect" target="_blank">mortgage application process</a> as to whether or not your mortgage may be sold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Selling mortgages is a very common practice and allows for more cash in the marketplace, so that lenders can make loans to more homebuyers.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Who’s Buying My Mortgage?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Among other buyers, you may find your mortgage being sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013, Fannie Mae provided approximately $4.1 trillion in liquidity, which enabled 3.7 million home purchases and 12.3 million mortgage refinancings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As you can tell, Fannie Mae purchases a lot of loans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that are part of a secondary market in home mortgages, purchasing mortgages from the lenders who originate them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They hold some of these mortgages, and some are securitized: sold in the form of securities and packaged.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are a student of recent history, you know that packaging subprime (aka high risk) mortgages into securities was part of the problem that caused our recession. The government has since passed various legislation and created the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to help prevent abuse and avoid another recession.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Wait.. seriously… my mortgage was sold. What are my rights?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are two components of your loan that may be owned:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Mortgage Note</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Servicing Rights</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The owners of the note and servicing rights do not have to be the same company. That’s right, the holder of your note may not be the person that you are paying monthly for your mortgage. Oy Vey!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Do not fret – government regulations require that you as the borrower receive notice whenever there is a transfer of either component.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Truth in Lending Act was amended in 2009 to require that borrowers be notified when their mortgage was sold, transferred, or assigned to a new creditor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The notice must be provided within 30 days of the sale, transfer, or assignment, and must include information about the new creditor, the date of transfer, how to reach a party having authority to act on behalf of the new creditor, and recordation of the debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) provides protection for you if your mortgage was sold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Under RESPA, your present loan servicer is required to notify you in writing of the assignment, sale, or transfer of servicing rights at least 15 days before the effective date of the transfer. The new servicer or holder of your mortgage must also send you this notice no later than 15 days after the effective date. The note of transfer must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The effective date of the transfer, the date your current servicer will stop accepting payments and the date the new servicer will begin accepting them.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The name, address, and toll-free or collect call telephone number for the new servicer.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Information that tells whether you can continue any optional insurance, such as mortgage life or disability insurance, and what action, if any, you must take to maintain coverage.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A statement that the transfer of servicing does not affect any term or condition of your mortgage documents other than the terms directly related to the servicing of the loan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The last bullet point is important to remember: the transfer of servicing does not affect any term or condition of your mortgage documents other than the terms directly related to the servicing of the loan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In other words, make sure the new owner or servicer of your loan is not attempting to change anything about your loan other than your payment procedures and other servicing elements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other items to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">During the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of the transfer, the payment may not be treated as late if you mistakenly send it to the old mortgage servicer instead of the new one.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If you have questions or problems with the servicing of your loan, the servicer is required to respond to you. Write to your servicer and call it a &#8220;qualified written request under Section 6 of RESPA.&#8221; It should be a separate letter and not mailed with your payment. The mortgage servicer must respond to you within 60 business days of receipt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">But I just received a letter from another company that the servicing of my loan has been transferred.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned earlier, your mortgage can be held by one company and serviced by another. Some holders of loans are not experts in the servicing and collection of their payments. Therefore, they transfer the servicing rights for a fee to another company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, your loan may be owned by Fannie Mae, but serviced by Wells Fargo. In this example, your payments and questions will all be directed to Wells Fargo, but the company that ultimately holds your mortgage loan is Fannie Mae.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Can my mortgage be sold again?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Yes, your mortgage can be sold again and may be sold multiple times during the life of the loan. Long gone are the days where you walk to your local bank for your mortgage and they own and service your mortgage for the life of the loan. While your mortgage will most likely be sold in today’s market, it is this fast moving economy that allows for mortgages to be issued in both up and down economies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Let&#8217;s face it, homebuyers need help navigating the mortgage jungle, but it’s difficult to know who you are dealing with when mortgage companies <a title="Why do Mortgage Companies Love Advertising Low Interest Rates?" href="/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/">focus on low interest rates </a>with little more information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage Brokers and Direct Mortgage Lenders both market their ability to find you a mortgage, but there are serious differences between them and what’s best for you.<span id="more-1962"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Buying a home is likely the most significant purchase you will ever make and it’s important to know who you might be working with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To do so, let&#8217;s discuss the major differences between Mortgage Brokers and Direct Mortgage Lenders, namely, whether you will have access to multiple lenders, mortgage fees and disclosures, and efficiencies.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Access to Lenders</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A Mortgage Broker works with multiple lenders, which means that they will be able to shop around on your behalf for the best loan that meets your needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With estimates of over 7,000 lenders in the country, a mortgage broker may provide you with the best opportunity to find a mortgage even if you are in a niche that some lenders avoid, such as lower credit score, investment properties, higher debt, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This competition should ensure that you are receiving the most competitive loan on any given day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In comparison, Direct Mortgage Lenders do not shop around for the best lender that meets your needs, because they are the lender. If you meet the specific lender’s criteria for a loan, you may be in luck; however, if not, you may need to restart your mortgage loan search and begin the process all over again.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Mortgage Fees and Disclosures</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Because <a title="How Are Mortgage Interest Rates Calculated?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-mortgage-interest-rates-calculated/">mortgage interest rates</a> are often based on what happens in the secondary markets, rates available to lenders won’t vary too much. However, the mortgage fees attached to those rates can vary greatly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage Brokers must disclose their fee under federal law; however, Direct Mortgage Lenders do not need to. This can open the door for a lack of transparency in what a Direct Lender is truly charging for their service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether you choose a Broker or Direct Lender, be sure to ask about fees up front.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Efficiencies</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Everyone can agree that the mortgage process is incredibly inefficient, regardless of whether you use a Mortgage Broker or Direct Mortgage Lender.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A Mortgage Broker can spend time trying to do too much on their own while a Direct Mortgage Lender may pass your documents through multiple hands in their own company increasing the likelihood of mistakes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To cut down on inefficiency, we built a <a title="Hipposcore | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.MortgageHippo.com/hipposcore">proprietary search algorithm</a>(based on the most advanced <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>) and loan closing dashboard to ensure our customers have an efficient and painless home buying experience.</p>
