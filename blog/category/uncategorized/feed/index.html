				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buying a home is most people’s dream. But getting a mortgage can sometimes be a nightmare, especially if you&#8217;re a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a>. The process can be a royal pain in the neck, to say the least (trust me, I’ve been there), and there’s just so much misinformation floating around, it’s dizzying. What’s even worse is that most people don’t spend the time to do it right. In fact, research shows that people typically put more effort into shopping for a car or vacation than for a home loan.</p>
<p>That’s just crazy! Buying a home is the largest, most important purchase most people will make in their lives, and you’re telling me they focus more on booking a trip to the Bahamas? I mean, I get it, vacations are awesome, but c’mon, this is your hard-earned money we’re talking about here, people! This is a long-term investment and the roof you put over your family’s heads. I know you&#8217;re not looking to become an expert in mortgages, but I just ask that you give it the attention it deserves.<span id="more-6"></span></p>
<p>In any event, this is what <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a> is all about: taking the pain out of the mortgage process so you can move on with your life, and, why not, even making it a little fun while we’re at it (after all, you should be excited about buying your home or refinancing into a better mortgage). How are we doing this, you ask? Great question. Here are just a few things you can expect from us:</p>
