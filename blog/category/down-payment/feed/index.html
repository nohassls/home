				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few people know about down payment assistance programs. When talking to potential homebuyers, one issue that is consistently brought up is lack of savings to pay for down payment.</p>
<p>First, there is the misconception out there that you <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">need 20% down payment</a> to purchase a home. Is it great to have 20% and <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">avoid paying private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI)? Yes, of course. Is it necessary? Definitely not. You can have as little as 5% down payment on conventional loans and 3.5% on FHA loans.</p>
<p>The second misconception, and the one I want to focus on today, is that if you don’t have enough money saved up to even pay the 5% down payment, then you can’t purchase the home. There are many down payment assistance grants, interest-free second mortgages, and other mortgage programs out there to help potential home buyers with the issue of lack of down payment.<span id="more-489"></span></p>
<p>These down payment assistance programs are plentiful and cover the gamut of home buyers, and you don’t have to be a low-income household to qualify for many of these programs. In fact, in some areas of the country you can earn considerably more than your area’s median income and still be eligible for down payment assistance. Sometimes high-income earners can qualify for a grant of up to 5% of the purchase price of the home!</p>
<p>So how much can you expect to get in assistance? The average assistance can go anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the city, county, or state that you live in. In some high-cost areas, the down payment assistance can be as much as $100,000. A lot of these down payment programs are setup as a silent, interest-free, second mortgage that only needs to be repaid when the home is sold or paid-off.</p>
<p>I want to make the caveat that just because you can access down payment assistance programs, it does not mean that you should be purchasing a home that’s pricier than you can afford.</p>
<p>First you should always <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">determine how much home you can afford</a> (monthly mortgage payment plus other costs). If you don’t have the 5% down payment for that home price saved up, or you simply don’t want to use all of your savings on a down payment, start looking at down payments assistance programs to cover the remaining down payment amount.</p>
<p>The important thing for lenders is that you have decent credit and can document your income thoroughly: they want to make sure that you have the ability to repay the loan. If the home you’re purchasing qualifies for a down payment assistance program and your lender is signed up to participate in that particular program that you’re interested in, they will handle the paperwork to help you get the assistance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Down payment gift money has become an increasingly popular source of funds for first time homebuyers. John Mayer says: “fathers be good to your daughters.” Today, we want to reverse and amplify that to say: “daughters and sons be good to your mothers and fathers&#8230; and even other relatives too.”</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, they are literally the reason you are here, but they can also be a great source of down payment funds for that dream home you’ve been looking to buy.<span id="more-471"></span></p>
<p>First off, let’s set the record straight when it comes to down payments. You DO NOT need to put a <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">20% down payment to buy a home</a>. That is a myth that needs to be debunked immediately. That being said, if you can put 20% down, you would avoid paying <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage insurance</a> (mortgage insurance protects the lender in the event you default on your loan). But if you can’t put 20% down, you can put down as little as 5% with most conventional loan programs. You can even go down to 3.5% with an FHA loan (but that carries certain additional expenses we will discuss at a later time). To see your different down payment options and loan programs, check out our <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>.</p>
<p>Now back to the specific matter at hand: a down payment gift.</p>
<p>Simply stated, a down payment gift is a gift of liquid monetary value to be used for the specific purpose of putting money down for the purchase of a residential property. As the name implies, it’s a gift. It’s not a loan that must be repaid; the lender will make sure to document it as such.</p>
<h2>Documenting the Gift</h2>
<p>The lender will typically require a down payment <i>gift letter</i> from the gifter (the person making the gift, e.g., your mom) stating that the funds do not need to be repaid. If the down payment gift money must be repaid, it’s considered a loan (not a gift) and its payment must be factored into your monthly expenses.</p>
<p>In addition to making it clear that the funds are a gift, the <i>down payment gift letter</i> should also state the amount and date of the gift, the subject property address (the address of the property you are buying), and the relationship between the gifter and the giftee (that’s you, by the way).</p>
<p>Most lenders will also require a full paper trail of the transfer of funds from the gifter to the giftee. This can be accomplished in multiple ways and depends on the type of transfer that occurred.</p>
<p>The easiest and most common way is for the gifter to write a check for the exact gift amount to the giftee. In this case, you can submit a copy of the check (both sides) as proof of transfer as well as the giftee’s bank statement showing that the check cleared. The gifter will also need to provide a bank account statement showing the funds for the gift being withdrawn from the gifter’s account.</p>
<p>Note: if the gifted funds were not in the gifter’s bank account for a certain period of time (two statement cycles) prior to the down payment gift being made, you must also keep a paper trail tracing the funds back to its original source. For example, let’s say your dad sold some stock from his brokerage account to give you the down payment gift. In that case, the lender will ask for evidence of the stock sale and the transfer of funds from your dad’s brokerage account to the bank account from which the gift was made.</p>
<p>The gifter can also wire the funds to the giftee. Although this may be simpler than writing a check, showing evidence of a wire is harder, and the name of the game is to make things as simple as possible for the lender. Trust me, it’s for your own good.</p>
<p>Also in the spirit of maximum simplicity, it is highly advisable that the giftee deposit the down payment gift money into the same bank account where the rest of the funds that will be used for closing are coming from (i.e. the rest of your down payment funds, funds to cover <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">closing costs</a> and financial reserves that may be required by the lender).</p>
<h2>Other Important Stuff About Gifts</h2>
<ul>
<li>It used to be that if you were buying a home with at least 20% down, ALL of your down payment could come from a down payment gift, but if you were putting less than 20% down, a big chunk of the down payment amount had to come from the borrower and not from a gift. New rules are making this requirement less stringent and allowing borrowers to use gift money for their entire down payment, even if the total down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price, as long as they are purchasing a one unit primary residence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can only use down payment gifts to purchase a primary or second home, but not for an investment property. With FHA loans, you can only use gift funds for a primary home.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want to completely avoid documenting the gift money for a down payment, you can do this by making sure the funds are in your bank account at least three months prior to submitting your bank account statements to the lender for the first time. This is referred to as “seasoning” of funds. The lender will only scrutinize your bank account activity for the last two statement cycles. Any funds deposited into your bank account before then are “seasoned” and the lender will generally not inquire about them. By the way, this is perfectly legal (we’re not teaching you how to deceive your lender here).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>There may be tax implications for making and receiving gifts, so make sure to consult your tax advisor (or maybe your parents’ tax advisor).</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oh, and please don’t forget to thank your gifter(s) – it’s the right thing to do!</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">One question frequently on the minds of <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a> is: How much should I put down toward my home? The go-to answer is 20% of the value of the home, but that might not always be the best choice.<span id="more-133"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The reason why most people recommend putting 20% down payment on a home is that banks and mortgage lenders don’t require homebuyers to purchase <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/"><strong>Private Mortgage Insurance</strong></a> (commonly known as PMI) when the amount is equal to or greater than 20% of the purchase price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the down payment is below 20%, the bank requires you to pay PMI to protect themselves against the possibility of default, which ends up being included in your monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Keep in mind, however, that PMI will go away once you’ve paid off a certain amount of the loan: when the Loan-to-Value reaches 78%).</p>
<p dir="ltr">As you can imagine, not having to pay PMI can reduce your monthly mortgage payment by quite a bit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s walk through an example to compare the numbers:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Steve and his wife are looking to put in a bid on a home valued at $300,000. They each have a good <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">credit score</a> and have enough money saved to comfortably put down 20%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They know that PMI will be applied for a down payment of less than 20%, but want to see exactly how much they’d be paying per month at different down payment amounts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If Steve and his wife put 20% down ($60,000), their monthly mortgage payment as of today would be approximately <strong>$1,590</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If they put 19% down ($57,000),  they’d have to purchase PMI and their monthly payment goes up to <strong>$1,694</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If they put 5% down ($15,000), which is usually the bare minimum you can put down with most conventional loan programs today, their monthly payment on that $300,000 home would be approximately <strong>$2,000</strong>.</p>

</table>
</div>
<p><em>(Note: the interest rate on a higher down payment may go down, but we will keep it constant for the purpose of comparison)</em></p>
</div>
<h2 dir="ltr"></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr">When does it make sense to put down less than 20%?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As you can see, the difference between 20% down and 5% down for Steve and his wife is <strong>$410</strong> in their monthly mortgage payment – a 20% difference! That’s pretty substantial.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flipside, Steve and his wife would be keeping $45,000 liquid if they decided to put down 5% rather than 20%. That’s also pretty substantial.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Going back to the example above, the yearly PMI at the 5% down payment level is $2,172.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The question now is: is it worth it for Steve and his wife to put down an additional $45,000 today for the opportunity of saving $2,172 per year for some years (in fact, about 8 years in this case based on this loan’s amortization schedule)?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, only Steve and his wife know the answer to that question. Maybe they’re better off investing the $45k in the stock market, or making home improvements to their new home, or starting a business. Or maybe they just feel nice and cozy knowing that they have an extra $45k in the bank, you know, for a rainy day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Everyone’s opportunity cost is different, but the point here is that money has an opportunity cost and this is something Steve and his wife should consider when deciding how much they should put down on their home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That might not always be 20%.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Final words of wisdom on down payments</h2>
<p dir="ltr">All in all, the steps for a homebuyer to determine how much to give as down payment are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Determine the maximum you can afford to pay in monthly mortgage payments.</strong> This is usually a fairly easy exercise since you know your monthly income and how much you can afford to pay in rent. The monthly mortgage payment will probably not stray too far away from what you’re currently paying in rent, but be sure to account for not-so-obvious home expense such as repairs and insurance.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Determine how long you think you’re going to be staying at the property you’re looking to buy.</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Determine how much money you have available as of this moment for down payment.</strong> It is also worth calculating how much you can save every month to increase that amount.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Using a good <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>, determine the value of the <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">home you can afford</a> based on the target monthly mortgage payment you determined in Step 1.</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Play around with the down payment amount and home price to arrive at a comfortable number.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">As you can see, every single situation is different and the down payment strategy depends on many variables that are particular to you.</p>
