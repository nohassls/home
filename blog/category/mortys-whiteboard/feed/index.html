				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adjustable Rate Mortgages, known as ARMs, got a bad rap during the recent crisis, but the ARMs offered these days are different from the ones offered then. For the right type of borrower, even a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a>, these adjustable rate mortgages can be great products that save you lots of money on your mortgage.<span id="more-426"></span></p>
<p>As the name indicates, ARM&#8217;s have adjustable <a title="How Are Mortgage Interest Rates Calculated?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-mortgage-interest-rates-calculated/" target="_blank">mortgage rates</a> that fluctuate according to general economic conditions, as opposed to fixed-rate mortgages, which offer the same interest rate for the life of the loan. Before you start gasping for air at the thought that the interest rate on your mortgage might increase, you must know that hybrid adjustable rate mortgages available in the market today have an initial fixed rate period of either 3, 5, 7, or even 10 years.</p>
<p>During this initial fixed rate period, the mortgage rate stays the same. If you locked in a 3.75% interest rate, it&#8217;s going to stay at 3.75%. It only starts to fluctuate after the initial fixed rate period expires. The benefit to you is that the interest rate during the initial fixed rate period is lower than the interest rate of most fixed rate mortgages and can lead to significant monthly savings.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the risk of an adjustable rate mortgage? Well, that you might stay in your property longer than the initial fixed rate period and that the interest rate may increase after the initial period expires, leading to payment shock.</p>
<p>But even if this happens, these products have interest rate adjustment caps that limit the amount by which the interest rate can increase after the initial fixed rate period expires.</p>
<p>Let me explain this a bit more:</p>
<p>Adjustable rate mortgages have three interest rate adjustments caps to protect the borrower from sharp rate spikes. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial rate cap</strong>: applies to the first interest rate adjustment after the initial fixed rate period expires.</li>
<li><strong>Periodic rate cap</strong>: applies to all subsequent rate adjustments after the initial adjustment.</li>
<li><strong>Lifetime cap</strong>: applies to all adjustments so that the interest rate on your loan can never be higher than the lifetime cap.</li>
</ol>
<p>To illustrate how these caps work to protect the borrower, let&#8217;s take a typical adjustable rate mortgage with an initial fixed rate period of 5 years, an initial interest rate of 3.75% that adjusts once per year after the first 5 years, and interest rate caps of 2/2/5 (initial rate cap of 2%, periodic rate cap of 2%, and lifetime cap of 5%). What this means is that the interest rate cannot increase by more than 2 percentage points at the initial adjustment (no higher than 5.75%) nor can it increase by more than another 2 percentage points at any adjustment after that. Over the life of the loan, the interest rate can never go above 8.75% (i.e., 3.75% plus 5%).</p>
<p>However, even with these caps, if your mortgage rate increases, you might experience payment shock and be unable to make your monthly mortgage payment. This is precisely why these products are not for every type of borrower.</p>
<p>So when is an adjustable rate mortgage a good choice for you?</p>
<p>This is a very case-specific decision, but let&#8217;s start with a good rule of thumb. An adjustable rate mortgage could be a good choice for you if you meet the following five criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have cash available to make a higher <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a> – since adjustable rate mortgages typically require at least 10% down (versus the 5% down required for most conventional home loans).</li>
<li>You are keeping the property for a short period of time – less than 7 years.</li>
<li>You have a good level of certainty that you won&#8217;t be staying in the property longer than you expect.</li>
<li>You can financially tolerate a measured mortgage payment increase.</li>
<li>You will be able to sleep at night knowing that your interest rate and your monthly payment might increase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, a rule of thumb is a good starting point, but it shouldn&#8217;t be your ending point too. Taking out a mortgage is serious business and you should treat it as such. Take the time to really assess your situation, determine <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">how much home can you afford</a>, and find the right loan to fit your needs. Fortunately for you, we&#8217;ve built a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> that helps you go beyond rules of thumb. Not doing this can be very costly!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">One of the most important things you can do when you <a title="Morty’s House-Hunting Tips and Essentials" href="/blog/mortys-house-hunting-tips-essentials/">begin your home search</a> is determine how much home you can afford. In this installment of Morty&#8217;s Whiteboard, we’re going to walk you through the home affordability analysis so that you can go home-hunting like an expert.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that at MortgageHippo, we’ve built a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> to make figuring out home affordability a breeze, so don’t sweat the math.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok, let’s get started.<span id="more-251"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Home Affordability: Down Payment</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are two factors that determine how much home you can afford: your <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a> and the maximum monthly mortgage payment you can afford, according to guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The down payment part is very simple: how much money do you have available for a down payment?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Different loan programs have different guidelines on where your down payment can come from (e.g., <a title="What to Know Before Receiving a Down Payment Gift" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/receiving-down-payment-gift/" target="_blank">down payment gift</a> from parents, etc.), but for now let’s just assume you have <strong>$15,000</strong> in the bank ready to be used for your down payment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since many loan programs need a minimum of 5% down, the maximum loan amount you’ll be able to qualify for based on down payment alone is <strong>$300,000</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ll come back to this number at the end of our analysis to make sure we’re not looking for a property that exceeds this amount.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Home Affordability: Maximum Monthly Mortgage Payment</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Down payment was cake, right? Gear up, figuring out the monthly payment affordability part isn&#8217;t quite as simple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are several factors to consider here: the interest rate on your loan (impacted by your <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">credit score</a>), the loan term, property taxes and insurance, your gross monthly income, your monthly debt obligations (credit cards, car payments, student loans, etc.), and the Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio (expected monthly mortgage expense plus other monthly debt obligations divided by your monthly income) permitted by the loan program.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“You lost me at ‘several factors’.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok, fair enough. To simplify our example, let’s make the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Loan Term:</strong> 30 years</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Interest Rate (based on a credit score of 720):</strong> 4.375%</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Property taxes and Insurance:</strong> $330/month</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>DTI Ratio permitted by loan program:</strong> up to 43%</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Gross Monthly Income:</strong> $5,000</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Monthly Debt Obligations:</strong> $650</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s take a quick look at the formula to determine your monthly payment affordability:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Max. Monthly Payment = (Gross Monthly Income x DTI Ratio) – Monthly Debt Obligations</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Now let’s plug in some numbers based on the assumptions above:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Max. Monthly Payment = ($5,000 x 0.43) &#8211; $650</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">So&#8230;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Max. Monthly Payment = $1,500</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This maximum monthly payment includes <a title="Mortgage Calculator | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-calculator-to-calculate-monthly-mortgage-payments/">principal, interest, taxes, and insurance</a>. But what really matters when figuring out what loan amount you can afford is to just look at principal and interest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So let’s subtract $330 from the Max. Monthly Payment of $1,500, leaving us with a <strong>Maximum Monthly Principal &amp; Interest </strong>of<strong> $1,170</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on this Max. Monthly Principal &amp; Interest, the maximum loan amount for which you would qualify at the assumed interest rate of 4.375% on a 30-year loan is <strong>$234,334.98</strong>. Boom!</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Wait, where did you get that number from? Well, we have a serious <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> that we built for ourselves and our customers.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to keep your DTI Ratio in the safe zone of 36%, instead of 43%, the maximum loan amount for which you would qualify is <strong>$164,234.77</strong>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Home Affordability: Property Price</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Now let’s add your $15,000 down payment to these two loan amounts to determine your property price range:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ideal Property Price = $164,235 + $15,000 = $179,235</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Upper Limit Property Price = $234,335 + $15,000 = $249,335</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, let’s get back to our down payment limit of $300,000 to check the upper limit property price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your upper limit exceeded $300,000, you would be constrained by the amount you have available for a down payment. In this case, your upper limit of $250k is below your down payment limit, so we’re good!</p>
<p dir="ltr">So how much house can you afford given this analysis? Between $180k and $250K. The closer you stay to your ideal price of $180k, the better, but it’s also good to know you can stretch a little if you find your dream house.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</p>
<p dir="ltr">We agree, figuring out &#8220;how much home can I afford?&#8221; can get a little complicated. The good news is that, at MortgageHippo, we’re developing the smartest mortgage tool out there to seamlessly walk <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a> through this and other mortgage decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So put your calculator down and enjoy your home buying experience to the fullest!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Private Mortgage Insurance, or PMI, is a type of insurance that protects mortgage lenders against borrower default risk. In other words, if you stop paying your mortgage, your PMI insurance company will cover a certain amount of the loan balance.<span id="more-190"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Private mortgage insurance has nothing to do with life insurance, and we shake our heads in disbelief when “experts” suggest so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For conventional mortgages (mortgages that are not insured or guaranteed by government agencies), private mortgage insurance is typically required when the borrower’s Loan-to-Value (LTV) is greater than 80%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the way, LTV is the principal balance of the loan divided by the value of the property. If you put a $30,000 down payment on a home worth $300,000, your initial LTV would be 90%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is why many borrowers prefer to save <a title="Is a 20% down payment really your best bet?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/">enough money to put 20% down</a> on a purchase, therefore avoiding the extra monthly cost of private mortgage insurance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So how do you get rid of paying this additional <a title="Infographic: Monthly Mortgage Payment and Closing Costs Breakdown" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/monthly-mortgage-payment-breakdown/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage cost</a>?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Automatic Termination of Private Mortgage Insurance</h2>
<p dir="ltr">By law, your lender must automatically cancel your private mortgage insurance on the date your LTV is scheduled to reach 78% of your original home value, unless you’re not current on your monthly mortgage payments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s look at an example:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Purchase Price:</strong> $250,000<br />
<strong>Downpayment:</strong> $12,500 (5% of Purchase Price)<br />
<strong>Initial LTV:</strong> 95%<br />
<strong>Interest Rate:</strong> 4.25%<br />
<strong>Loan Term:</strong> 30 years (360 months)</p>

<p dir="ltr">As you can see, the private mortgage insurance on this loan is not due to be canceled until month 105 (a little less than 9 years after the loan was originated).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Request for Private Mortgage Insurance Cancellation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Is there a way to get rid of private mortgage insurance earlier than 78%? Yes, there is.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You have the right to request that your private mortgage insurance be canceled earlier, on the date your mortgage is scheduled to reach 80% LTV.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As you can see, this loan is scheduled to reach an 80% LTV on month 94. That means you can save nearly one year of monthly private mortgage insurance payments by asking your lender to cancel it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There may be, however, a small cost associated with making this request, along with some additional work of proving you are at 80% LTV.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can also make this request even earlier if you’ve made additional payments to reduce the principal balance of your loan.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">PMI is to conventional loan programs what MIP is to FHA loan programs, except that MIP is always required for FHA loan programs, regardless of your LTV.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another major difference between MIP and PMI: MIP never goes away for most FHA loans.  New FHA rules say that if a loan’s initial LTV is over 90%, MIP will be in effect for the life of the loan.</p>
<p>If the initial LTV is 90% or less, MIP must be paid for 11 years before it can be cancelled.</p>
<p>This is a major drawback of FHA loan programs and a very good reason to stay away from them if you can qualify for a conventional loan program.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">We’ve discussed whether to add a co-borrower to a mortgage application with many homebuyers and we’re always surprised to hear how many think having a co-borrower is a requirement for getting a mortgage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Especially borrowers who are married – many of them believe that their spouse needs to be on the mortgage loan.<span id="more-159"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is NOT a requirement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Did you know that even if you’re married, you can qualify for a mortgage loan on your own?  If you and your spouse both want to be on the title, then that’s a separate issue, but sharing the title does not require both of you to also be on the mortgage loan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it’s not a requirement, there are times when it makes sense to add a co-borrower to a mortgage application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s take a look:</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The two numbers to really pay attention to when thinking of adding a co-borrower</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The main question you need to ask yourself to determine whether adding a co-borrower makes sense is: what does that person bring to the table?</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Morty’s marriage counseling advice: do NOT ask your spouse what they bring to the table. The conversation ain’t gonna go where you want it to go.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">As far as mortgages go, there are only two positive things a co-borrower can bring to the table: income and assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many people mistakenly believe that <a title="What Recent Credit Score Changes Mean For Home Buyers" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/recent-credit-score-changes-mean-home-buyers/" target="_blank">credit score</a> is also something a co-borrower can bring to the table, but this, unfortunately, is not the case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yup. Lenders typically use the lower scoring borrower’s credit to underwrite the loan; so even if your co-borrower has stellar credit, but you have poor credit, this co-borrower won’t help at all from a credit perspective.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ideal scenario for adding a co-borrower is when that person has a credit score no more than 20 points lower than yours and he/she has solid financials to strengthen your mortgage application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s run through a quick example to really take this point home:</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">To add or not to add?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Kim is purchasing her first home in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago and is thinking about adding her dad as a co-borrower. Here is a quick snapshot of Kim’s credit and financial profile as compared to her dad’s:</p>
<div class="dptable" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 19px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 2px 0 #ddd; -webkit-border-radius: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">

<tr>

<p dir="ltr">$2,200*</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">44%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">16.6%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">*Kim’s monthly debt obligations include things such as car payments, credit cards, student loans as well as the mortgage loan for which she is applying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">**Kim’s dad’s debt obligations do not include the mortgage loan for which Kim is applying.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Even though her dad’s credit score is a little bit lower than Kim’s, it would likely make sense for Kim to add her dad as a co-borrower in this case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because Kim’s <strong>DTI Ratio</strong> is high and she may not qualify for a loan at that level (Ideally, the DTI should be no higher than 36%).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding her dad to the application would bring down the total <strong>DTI Ratio to 29%</strong> (($2,200+$1,000)/($5,000+$6,000)), a level at which they should comfortably qualify.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So once again, assuming that this loan program allows <a title="How is a Non-Occupying Co-Borrower Considered in a Mortgage Application?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/non-occupying-co-borrowers-considered-mortgage-application/" target="_blank">non-occupying co-borrowers</a> (because even though Kim loves her dad, she doesn’t want to live with him!), adding Kim’s dad as a co-borrower strengthens the loan application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now let’s look at a different scenario:</p>
<div class="dptable" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 19px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 2px 0 #ddd; -webkit-border-radius: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Monthly Income</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">$8,000</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">$3,000</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">27.5%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">33.3%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>*Kim’s monthly debt obligations include things such as car payments, credit cards, student loans as well as the mortgage loan for which she is applying.</p>
<p>**Kim’s dad’s debt obligations do not include the mortgage loan for which Kim is applying.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">In this scenario, Kim’s dad doesn’t add to the application and it likely doesn’t make sense to add him as a co-borrower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why not?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Compared to the last example, Kim’s monthly income increased and her dad’s monthly income decreased. At a <strong>DTI Ratio of 27.5%</strong>, Kim should be able to qualify for this loan by herself. Adding her dad’s monthly debts and income actually weakens the application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though her dad has stellar credit (780), the lender in this case will probably use Kim’s 680 credit score because she has the lowest score of the two.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</p>
<p dir="ltr">So this is it, folks. The decision to add a co-borrower depends on your particular circumstance, and now you know what factors should drive your decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Want an easier way to determine whether to add a co-borrower without doing all the calculations yourself?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Nobody has a crystal ball telling them where interest rates will be moving over the next few months, and this is why locking your <a title="How Are Mortgage Interest Rates Calculated?" href="/blog/how-mortgage-interest-rates-calculated/" target="_blank">mortgage interest rate</a> often makes sense: it protects you from uncertainty and volatility in the market by guaranteeing a set interest rate over a set period of time.<span id="more-104"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">If your interest rate goes up, so does your <a title="Infographic: Monthly Mortgage Payment and Closing Costs Breakdown" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/monthly-mortgage-payment-breakdown/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage payment</a> – this could prevent you from qualifying for your home loan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some lenders don’t even charge a fee for locking your rate, making it an even more attractive option for the typical borrower. If they do charge, many lenders simply build this cost into the interest rate you’re locking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Be sure to ask your loan officer if you are uncertain whether there is a cost.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How do rate locks work?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Lenders will typically let you lock your interest rate for a period of 30, 45, or even 60 days (or longer than 60 days in some cases).</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, if you lock your rate today (November 27) at 4.50%, this same interest rate will be available for you if you close your loan by December 27, even if rates move above 4.50%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What happens if interest rates go down between now and December 27? Well, it would be really nice to have your cake and it eat it too, right?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some lock contracts have “float-down” provisions that give you the flexibility to lock at a lower interest rate if one becomes available before your loan closing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, most lenders won’t let you do this. If they do, it often comes at a significant cost to you.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">When should I lock my rate and for how long?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The answer depends on your circumstances.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’ve already signed a purchase agreement on your home and the type of documentation your lender requires is readily available, then you should be able to lock your rate as soon as you’re approved and close within 30 days (in which case a 30-day lock is sufficient).</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, if you’re purchasing a short sale, there’s no point on even locking your rate until the seller’s lender approves it. This could take months!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Final words of wisdom on rate locks</h2>
<p dir="ltr">All in all, we usually recommend locking your rate more often than we recommend letting it float, but we strongly suggest that you take the time to think it through.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are two more parting thoughts on rate locks:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Discuss the rate lock thoroughly with your loan officer. A good loan officer will help you understand all the pros and cons as well as help you determine when to lock, for how long and whether it makes sense for you to pay for a float-down (if available).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Keep track of the rate lock expiration date and don’t just rely on your loan officer (even if you’re working with the best).  Take control over your mortgage process and make sure that you submit all required documentation on time to keep the process running smoothly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">To help you keep track of your rate lock, as well as all of your mortgage application documents and deadlines, we’ve built an easy-to-use <a href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">Mortgage Loan Closing Plan </a>with access to a personal MortgageHippo mortgage guide and the most advanced <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> out there.</p>
