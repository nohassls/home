				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Tax Day is almost here. Before you freak out, we have an important topic to cover for homeowners before you file your taxes: the mortgage interest deduction, a.k.a. the biggest deduction most homeowners will have on their tax returns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of the year, mortgage companies will send homeowners a form 1098 that details all of mortgage interest paid out of each monthly mortgage payment. From that total, taxpayers will be able to deduct from their owed federal taxes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s take a closer look at what exactly is included in this deduction and what changes we may see in the future.<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What can I count as mortgage interest on my tax returns?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">For homeowners, mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan secured by your primary or secondary home. These loans include a mortgage to buy your home (first mortgage), a second mortgage, a line of credit, or a home equity loan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You cannot deduct interest on your tax returns on a mortgage loan for a third home, fourth home etc.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How much mortgage interest can I deduct on my tax returns?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If your situation falls within one of these three categories, then you can deduct all of the mortgage interest you paid in the last calendar year, potentially saving you a lot of money on your taxes:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Mortgages (taken after October 13, 1987) that totaled $1 million or less throughout the year ($500,000 if you’re married and filing separately from your spouse) that was used to buy, build, or improve your primary or your secondary home.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Mortgages (taken before October 13, 1987) that were used to buy, build, or improve your primary or your secondary home.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Home equity debt (taken after October 13, 1987) that totaled $100,000 or less ($50,000 if you’re married and filing separately from your spouse) that was taken out on your primary or secondary home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Who gets to take the mortgage interest tax deduction?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The answer is pretty simple. If you are the primary borrower on the mortgage loan, you can take the deduction. If you’re married and both of you signed for the loan, then both of you are primary borrowers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, if you’re helping somebody pay their mortgage, for example a family member (son, daughter, mother, father, Morty the Hippo), but you didn’t co-sign for the loan, then you are not eligible to take the interest deduction on your tax returns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your lovely family member takes all the tax benefits and thanks you with an awesome high five.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Congress going to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction for future tax years?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This topic is being debated almost every day in our nation’s capital and around the country. Congress is discussing a major tax overhaul and almost all tax deductions, including the mortgage interest deductions, have been put on the discussion table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Supporters of the mortgage interest deduction say it promotes homeownership and gives the middle class a better shot at financial security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The deduction helps middle income families build equity in their homes and makes mortgage payments more affordable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Critics of the mortgage interest rate deduction say that it actually helps higher income families more than middle/lower income families who nowadays are mostly renters and not homeowners. In other words, that the intended purpose of the deduction is not really being met.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They also say that in the tough economic times, any extra tax revenue will help the country move forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a>, we believe that the mortgage interest deduction helps families across our country move into the middle class and achieve the dream of homeownership. Any tax overhaul or substitute to the mortgage interest deduction should take this into account and promote accessible homeownership for the middle class.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But don’t be scared my fellow tribe, most of the discussion about the mortgage interest deduction has centered around lowering the limits on mortgages that qualify for the deduction from the current $1 million in principal to $500,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It doesn’t seem that the mortgage interest deduction will be eliminated completely. And in any case, this debate will not apply to you this tax year. Let’s see what happens next year for all you potential <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Best friends, unmarried couples, co-habitating family members – lend Morty your ears!</p>
<p dir="ltr">You may be living with a partner, friend, or family member and wondering why you are paying rent month after month, year after year, with no end in sight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are currently looking at the person on the couch next to you and thinking, “hey, renting is soooo last decade. Let’s buy an asset together!” then this post if for you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">MortgageHippo</a>, we welcome aspiring homeowners of all shapes, sizes, and relationships. But before you high five from across the couch, know that buying an asset of any value is more complex when purchasing with another person. Purchasing a home is no exception.<span id="more-264"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">First-time home buyers</a> should not be dissuaded from purchasing a home solely due to their marital status. Before buying a home with another person, think about the future and how your relationship with that person or your expectations may change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Is the person living with you – whether your best friend Betty or your boyfriend Bobby – going to be the person you would like to live with over the next year, 5 years, or even 30 years ? Do you really want to bring a property into the complex world of your relationship?</p>
<p dir="ltr">You will feel much more comfortable buying an asset together if you consider the following factors:</p>
<p dir="ltr">First, and most importantly, talk to one another. Swap financial information, expectations, and future plans while also discussing the “what ifs”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What if one person wants to move out, what if one person cannot afford to pay a portion of the bills, what happens if one person wants to sell their interest, what if… you get the point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Secondly, determine how much you both can afford together.  We recently wrote a blog entry on the topic of <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">home affordability and how to determine it</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, if after all of this you still want to purchase a home together, consider your homeownership title options: joint tenant ownership or tenants in common.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Under joint tenant ownership, each person owns the property equally and his or her share – this is about to get grim &#8211; is transferred to the surviving person upon the death of the first person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Under tenants in common, each person owns a percentage of the property (not necessarily equally) and if there is a death of one of the owners, their ownership percentage will go to their beneficiary (as stated in their will) or next of kin. So, under tenants in common, you can each decide to own a percentage of the home based upon your percentage of contribution to the <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a> or expenses, or any other way you see fit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">With all of this in mind, put your expectations and “what ifs” down on paper and draft a formal agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure it explains who is contributing financially, the expenses for which each partner is responsible, how much equity each partner will receive in the event of a sale, and sorry to get a bit grim again, what would happen to the ownership of the home in the event of one person’s death.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You will both feel much better if your agreement of “what ifs” is down in writing.</p>
<p>Now you have done the hard part, you do NOT need to consider the pains and headaches of the mortgage process, because MortgageHippo was designed to make the mortgage process simple, transparent, and efficient.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Visit our blog about <a title="Should I add a co-borrower to my mortgage application?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/add-co-borrower-to-a-mortgage-application/" target="_blank">mortgage co-borrowers</a> to consider whether you both should be on the mortgage together (there are pros and cons), and next jump into our <a title="Mortgage Pre-Approval" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/interview" target="_blank">mortgage pre-approval</a> map to determine the best mortgage for your needs.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When does it make sense to add a non-occupying co-borrower to your mortgage application? We’ve already talked about when it makes sense to <a title="Adding a Co-Borrower" href="/blog/add-co-borrower-to-a-mortgage-application/">consider adding a spousal co-borrower</a>, who presumably is an occupying co-borrower – or someone who resides at the property with you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But what about adding someone who won’t live with you? Well, that’s a different story. Unfortunately, this is a very loan program-specific decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let me tell you why.<span id="more-181"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The main reason to add a co-borrower to your mortgage loan application is if they bring something to the table with respect to income and/or assets, helping you qualify for the loan or maybe helping you qualify for a better loan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This still holds true for non-occupying co-borrowers – add them only if they bring something to the table to qualify or get a better deal – but the key to knowing whether someone is a good candidate is to know the quirks of the different loan programs available that allow non-occupying co-borrowers.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Income &amp; Assets</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Some conventional loan programs that allow a non-occupying co-borrower require that the main borrower qualify on his/her own when it comes to satisfying income and assets requirements. But this sort of defeats the purpose of adding the co-borrower in the first place if you’re only adding them to improve your chances of qualification?</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you can qualify on your own, then you may not even need the co-borrower at all.</p>
<h2>Credit</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Other loan programs, however, do make it easier to qualify with a non-occupying co-borrower. In addition to looking at the income and assets of both you and your co-borrower, these programs will rely on your co-borrower’s <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">credit score</a> if yours is too low. This could be an awesome option if your credit isn’t so great!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Relationship</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Another quirk to keep in mind is that many loan programs require that your non-occupying co-borrower be related to you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is yet another reason to be super nice to your parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and step-relationships. Cousins are fair game for abuse since they don’t seem to be included in this list of potential related non-occupying co-borrower possibilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some loan programs such as the FHA Non-Occupying Co-Borrower program, are more flexible with the relationship requirement. However, with this FHA program, if your co-borrower is not related to you, the <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment requirement</a> will be much larger and the lender will insist that you have a long-standing relationship with your co-borrower – so start looking for a long-time family friend or co-worker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oh, and be prepared to show proof of this long-standing relationship because the lender will ask for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decision to add a non-occupying co-borrower to your home loan application requires you to understand the quirks of the loan program to which you’re applying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a>, we’re busy making our <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> and closing plan better and better to help you sort through this mess to find and recommend loan programs that adjust to your particular needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">We’ve discussed whether to add a co-borrower to a mortgage application with many homebuyers and we’re always surprised to hear how many think having a co-borrower is a requirement for getting a mortgage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Especially borrowers who are married – many of them believe that their spouse needs to be on the mortgage loan.<span id="more-159"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is NOT a requirement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Did you know that even if you’re married, you can qualify for a mortgage loan on your own?  If you and your spouse both want to be on the title, then that’s a separate issue, but sharing the title does not require both of you to also be on the mortgage loan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it’s not a requirement, there are times when it makes sense to add a co-borrower to a mortgage application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s take a look:</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The two numbers to really pay attention to when thinking of adding a co-borrower</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The main question you need to ask yourself to determine whether adding a co-borrower makes sense is: what does that person bring to the table?</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Morty’s marriage counseling advice: do NOT ask your spouse what they bring to the table. The conversation ain’t gonna go where you want it to go.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">As far as mortgages go, there are only two positive things a co-borrower can bring to the table: income and assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many people mistakenly believe that <a title="What Recent Credit Score Changes Mean For Home Buyers" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/recent-credit-score-changes-mean-home-buyers/" target="_blank">credit score</a> is also something a co-borrower can bring to the table, but this, unfortunately, is not the case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yup. Lenders typically use the lower scoring borrower’s credit to underwrite the loan; so even if your co-borrower has stellar credit, but you have poor credit, this co-borrower won’t help at all from a credit perspective.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ideal scenario for adding a co-borrower is when that person has a credit score no more than 20 points lower than yours and he/she has solid financials to strengthen your mortgage application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s run through a quick example to really take this point home:</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">To add or not to add?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Kim is purchasing her first home in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago and is thinking about adding her dad as a co-borrower. Here is a quick snapshot of Kim’s credit and financial profile as compared to her dad’s:</p>
<div class="dptable" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 19px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 2px 0 #ddd; -webkit-border-radius: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Scenario 1 &#8211; Financial Profile</strong></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="373" />
<col width="102" />
<col width="102" /></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kim</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kim’s Dad</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Credit Score</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">680</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">670</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Monthly Debt Obligations</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">$2,200*</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">$1,000**</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Monthly Income</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">$5,000</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">$6,000</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">44%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">16.6%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">*Kim’s monthly debt obligations include things such as car payments, credit cards, student loans as well as the mortgage loan for which she is applying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">**Kim’s dad’s debt obligations do not include the mortgage loan for which Kim is applying.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Even though her dad’s credit score is a little bit lower than Kim’s, it would likely make sense for Kim to add her dad as a co-borrower in this case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because Kim’s <strong>DTI Ratio</strong> is high and she may not qualify for a loan at that level (Ideally, the DTI should be no higher than 36%).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding her dad to the application would bring down the total <strong>DTI Ratio to 29%</strong> (($2,200+$1,000)/($5,000+$6,000)), a level at which they should comfortably qualify.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So once again, assuming that this loan program allows <a title="How is a Non-Occupying Co-Borrower Considered in a Mortgage Application?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/non-occupying-co-borrowers-considered-mortgage-application/" target="_blank">non-occupying co-borrowers</a> (because even though Kim loves her dad, she doesn’t want to live with him!), adding Kim’s dad as a co-borrower strengthens the loan application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now let’s look at a different scenario:</p>
<div class="dptable" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 19px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 2px 0 #ddd; -webkit-border-radius: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">

<p>*Kim’s monthly debt obligations include things such as car payments, credit cards, student loans as well as the mortgage loan for which she is applying.</p>
<p>**Kim’s dad’s debt obligations do not include the mortgage loan for which Kim is applying.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">In this scenario, Kim’s dad doesn’t add to the application and it likely doesn’t make sense to add him as a co-borrower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why not?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Compared to the last example, Kim’s monthly income increased and her dad’s monthly income decreased. At a <strong>DTI Ratio of 27.5%</strong>, Kim should be able to qualify for this loan by herself. Adding her dad’s monthly debts and income actually weakens the application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though her dad has stellar credit (780), the lender in this case will probably use Kim’s 680 credit score because she has the lowest score of the two.</p>

<p dir="ltr">So this is it, folks. The decision to add a co-borrower depends on your particular circumstance, and now you know what factors should drive your decision.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Morty’s Whiteboard series</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a title="Morty's Whiteboard | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/category/mortys-whiteboard/">Morty’s Whiteboard</a> series will not only give you the knowledge and information to help better understand your mortgage options, but will also help you make sense of that information and apply it to your personal situation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage “experts” focus almost exclusively on sharing encyclopedic information on mortgages (e.g., what specific loan terms mean, where rates are going, how to pay points, etc.).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, information is always important.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, what these “experts” often ignore is giving you the right tools to make good use of that information. Think about this: How far would a homebuilder go without a hammer and saw? Blueprints alone are simply not enough if you don’t have the right tools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a>, we share valuable information with you but focus equally on the tools; because with the right tools, the information is turbocharged and ultimately made more useful. That’s our goal for you.</p>
