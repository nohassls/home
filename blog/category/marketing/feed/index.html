				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopping for a mortgage online is like going through a maze of mediocre websites and misinformation. The fact is that a lot of mortgage companies have gotten lazy: “Interest rates are at their lowest level! Let me ask you just a few questions and I’ll get you the lowest rate on the market!”</p>
<p>It’s easy to throw out <a title="Why do mortgage companies love advertising low interest rates?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/">low mortgage interest rates</a> and APRs. We’re all attracted to the shiny objects.</p>
<p>Imagine a regular homebuyer shopping for a mortgage on Google and ending up on one of these <a title="Why We Don’t Like Mortgage Referral Sites (And Why You Shouldn’t Either)" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites/" target="_blank">mortgage referral sites</a>. Most of these sites think, “Ok, he’s here. He’s gotta be looking for the lowest rate possible, so let’s feed it to him!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the person doesn’t really know what loan type and loan features he’s looking for. He simply knows, “I’ve heard about a lot of people getting into trouble with their mortgages and I want to make sure I get the best deal for my specific needs and profile.”</p>
<p>How effective is it to assume a borrower knows what he or she wants <i>before</i> shopping for a mortgage?<span id="more-92"></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of these mortgage sites will <a title="Mortgage Calculator | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-calculator-to-calculate-monthly-mortgage-payments/">throw tools and calculators</a> at you and expect you to have the time and know-how to figure out what your specific needs are.</p>
<h2>When it comes to finding the right mortgage, what do people REALLY want?</h2>
<p>99% of people care about getting a mortgage that’s right for them and have peace of mind. They could care less about learning the intricacies of the mortgage industry, fiddling with calculators, or following rates.</p>
<p>How do we know?</p>
<p>Before developing the mortgage algorithms behind MortgageHippo, we immersed ourselves in customer discovery and collected hundreds of data points along the way.</p>
<p>We went out into the world and talked to nearly everyone who would talk to us: <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a>, homeowners, <a title="When Should You Use a Real Estate Agent to Buy a Home?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-should-you-use-a-real-estate-agent-to-buy-a-home/" target="_blank">real estate agents</a>, mortgage loan originators, etc.</p>
<p>We visited almost every neighborhood in Chicago in search of answers.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand why so many Americans were ecstatic to buy a home but cringed at the thought of getting a mortgage, and why the most common words we kept hearing were: “confusing,” “intimidating” and “overwhelming.”</p>
<p>As I said, we were looking for answers.</p>
<p>Here are some things we learned:</p>
<p><b>People want…</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To understand the total costs involved, including <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">mortgage closing costs</a>, and not worry about being able to afford their monthly payments</li>
<li>To be in control</li>
<li>To get personalized, tailored recommendations for their personal situation</li>
<li>To get guidance throughout the entire application process from someone they trust</li>
<li>To take pride in the fact that they got a great deal (nobody really mentions the social aspect of personal finance)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>People do NOT want…</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To have to “learn” about the mortgage industry as a whole. They only care about their situation</li>
<li>To learn the industry jargon: FHA, VA, ARMs, buydown points, FHA, Fannie and Freddie, etc.</li>
<li>To have to calculate the numbers on their own to figure out which loans are better suited for their needs</li>
<li>To be teased with mortgage quotes offering interest rates and closing fees that they may not qualify</li>
</ul>
<p>These are no-brainers. You’d think most mortgage companies would understand all this, right? Here are more specific examples:</p>
<p>AWESOME: “Here’s an <a title="How It Works | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/howitworks">automated mortgage process</a> to generate loan offers based on your personal profile, and here’s <a title="HippoScore | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/hipposcore">the loan we recommend</a> above all others”</p>
<p>SUCKS: “Here are some low-rate loan offers that you <i>may or may not</i> qualify for. Click and see!” (Ughhh…)</p>
<p>AWESOME: “Here is your own mortgage closing plan to help you keep your application documents organized and in one place and know exactly what to expect from the <a title="What to Expect from the Mortgage Process" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/what_to_expect" target="_blank">entire mortgage process</a>. You’ll also be able to communicate directly with a personal mortgage guide to help you through any issues you may run into.”</p>
<p>SUCKS: “You’ve just selected a loan offer! We’re going to pass you off to someone else now. See ya later, and thanks for your Social Security number!” (Uhhh…what??)</p>
<p>AWESOME: “Here is a complete list of fees associated with these loan offers so you can fully assess and compare your offers.”</p>
<p>SUCKS: “APR and Payment examples shown do not include amounts for taxes and insurance premiums” (This is from a real referral site)</p>
<h2>What business are referral sites really in?</h2>
<p>There’s a very good reason these mortgage referral sites don’t even see themselves as mortgage companies. They aren’t.</p>
<p>They see themselves as marketing companies, because they are in effect providing a marketing function for the mortgage lenders that <a title="Why we don't like mortgage referral sites" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites/">advertise rates and fees on those sites</a>.</p>
<p>We’re as tired as most are of misleading mortgage tools that are looking to make a quick buck and pass you off to the next guy, without providing any real value. That’s why we built a system that walks you through the entire mortgage process without assuming anything other than that you are interested in securing the best mortgage for your specific needs and profile.</p>
<p>As we’ve said, it’s easy to advertise <a title="Why do mortgage companies love advertising low interest rates?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/">low mortgage interest rates</a> and get people’s attention. But marketing is not just advertising. Marketing is deeply understanding your audience—their fears, their motivations, their desires—and designing an end-to-end customer experience that adds real value to their lives.</p>
