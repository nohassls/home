				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few people know about down payment assistance programs. When talking to potential homebuyers, one issue that is consistently brought up is lack of savings to pay for down payment.</p>
<p>First, there is the misconception out there that you <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">need 20% down payment</a> to purchase a home. Is it great to have 20% and <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">avoid paying private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI)? Yes, of course. Is it necessary? Definitely not. You can have as little as 5% down payment on conventional loans and 3.5% on FHA loans.</p>
<p>The second misconception, and the one I want to focus on today, is that if you don’t have enough money saved up to even pay the 5% down payment, then you can’t purchase the home. There are many down payment assistance grants, interest-free second mortgages, and other mortgage programs out there to help potential home buyers with the issue of lack of down payment.<span id="more-489"></span></p>
<p>These down payment assistance programs are plentiful and cover the gamut of home buyers, and you don’t have to be a low-income household to qualify for many of these programs. In fact, in some areas of the country you can earn considerably more than your area’s median income and still be eligible for down payment assistance. Sometimes high-income earners can qualify for a grant of up to 5% of the purchase price of the home!</p>
<p>So how much can you expect to get in assistance? The average assistance can go anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the city, county, or state that you live in. In some high-cost areas, the down payment assistance can be as much as $100,000. A lot of these down payment programs are setup as a silent, interest-free, second mortgage that only needs to be repaid when the home is sold or paid-off.</p>
<p>I want to make the caveat that just because you can access down payment assistance programs, it does not mean that you should be purchasing a home that’s pricier than you can afford.</p>
<p>First you should always <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">determine how much home you can afford</a> (monthly mortgage payment plus other costs). If you don’t have the 5% down payment for that home price saved up, or you simply don’t want to use all of your savings on a down payment, start looking at down payments assistance programs to cover the remaining down payment amount.</p>
<p>The important thing for lenders is that you have decent credit and can document your income thoroughly: they want to make sure that you have the ability to repay the loan. If the home you’re purchasing qualifies for a down payment assistance program and your lender is signed up to participate in that particular program that you’re interested in, they will handle the paperwork to help you get the assistance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s now officially summer, and you know what that means, right? You guessed it: it’s home buying season. It’s also wedding season, baseball season, street festival season, and the season for all the great things that happen when the weather isn&#8217;t meant for polar bears.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During this home buying season, make sure your dream of homeownership doesn&#8217;t turn into a nightmare by avoiding these three very common home buying pitfalls.<span id="more-387"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Buying more home than you can afford</h2>
<p dir="ltr">But if you get approved for a loan of a certain size you must be able to afford it, right? Not so quick my friend. See, when you get approved for a loan amount, you’re typically approved based on your Debt-to-Income ratio: your monthly debts divided by your gross monthly income. The problem with this calculation is that monthly debt does not paint a full picture of your lifestyle. It doesn’t include your weekend trips to Vegas, your yearly vacation to the French Riviera, your daily $3+ Starbucks coffee, your $400 leather shoes, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The list goes on and on, but you get the point. People’s lifestyles are very different, and credit reports used by mortgage companies don’t necessarily capture that (unless you’re paying for your lavish lifestyle with credit cards, in which case you may not qualify for a loan at all). It’s up to you to be responsible and honest with yourself about <a title="How Much Home Can I Afford?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-much-home-can-i-afford/" target="_blank">how much home you can afford</a> and not just let mortgage guidelines determine that for you.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Rushing yourself through the home shopping process</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Finding the right home takes time. Don’t rush it. Don’t let your excitement take a hold of you to the point where you end up making a rash decision. <a title="Morty’s House-Hunting Tips and Essentials" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortys-house-hunting-tips-essentials/" target="_blank">Shopping for a home</a> is a lot of fun, but it’s also serious business. The following are just a few recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Write down a list of certain home features your new home must absolutely have or it’s a deal breaker (e.g. two bathrooms, a nice, open kitchen, etc.). This will keep you focused and keep you from falling in love with a home that doesn’t really meet your needs.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">When you find a home you like, make sure to visit it several times on several days of the week and at different times during the day. A home can look and feel very different on a calm and sunny Sunday afternoon than on a hectic and rainy Monday night.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If at all possible, get a home inspection (sometimes an inspection is required anyway). Avoid surprises and know exactly what you’re getting into. An inspection can also help you negotiate more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Keep a home buying journal. Write an entry every time you visit a home. What did you like? What didn’t you like? This will help you narrow down your list of finalists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not getting the right home loan for your needs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This is a big one.  Getting a mortgage that fits your needs can save you a lot of money and headache in the long run. Let me walk you through a quick example that illustrates this point very clearly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s say Luigi is buying his first home, and he expects to stay in that home for no longer than five years. In fact, he’s absolutely, 110%, super duper extra sure that he’ll sell the home the day before his fifth year anniversary of buying it. If this is the case, then a 5-year <a title="Adjustable Rate Mortgages Are Not Evil" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/adjustable-rate-mortgages-not-evil/" target="_blank">adjustable rate mortgage</a> (ARM) is the perfect loan for Luigi. He will never be exposed to the potential interest rate fluctuation of the loan, and he will enjoy its lower interest rate and lower monthly payment for five years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But no one is 100% certain about anything, so how can Luigi be so sure he’ll only stay in his home five years minus one day? Well, Luigi is a fictional superhero, and you’re right: us common folk don’t have those amazing powers. This is why an adjustable rate mortgage is not for everyone. There is an inherent risk with this product: if you stay longer than you expected, you may be exposed to interest rate fluctuations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lets face it &#8211; there is no better investment than education. It is the grand equalizer in our society. It enables social mobility – the ideal that one may come from nothing and yet, through education and hard work, achieve great things in life. This is a notion that has inspired generations of Americans since the founding of our country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cost of formal education is getting out of control and the ripple effects throughout the economy are severe. More and more college graduates are entering the workforce mired in student debt that ties them to their jobs and limits their opportunities for starting a business and forming a household of their own.<br />
In fact, student loan debt is one of the major factors keeping younger potential <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time homebuyers</a> out of the housing market. Student loans disproportionately affect younger homebuyers in two significant ways:<span id="more-360"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>By lengthening the time it would take to save for a <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">minimum down payment</a> and cover the <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">closing costs</a>.</li>
<li>By increasing the debt-to-income ratio to the point where the homebuyer may not qualify for a mortgage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Down payment and closing costs</h2>
<p>Let’s do some basic math to figure out the impact of student loans on a homebuyer’s ability to save enough money to cover the down payment and closing costs.</p>
<p>For many loan programs, the minimum down payment requirement is 5% of the purchase price and the closing costs can add up to another 3%. Unless one takes advantage of a <a title="How to Qualify for Down Payment Assistance Programs" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/down-payment-assistance-programs/" target="_blank">down payment assistance program</a>, the amount of cash needed to purchase a $200,000 home is $16,000 (i.e. 8% of the purchase price).</p>
<p>Now let’s figure out how long it would take a young homebuyer to save $16,000. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, “in 2011, the median of earnings for young adults (ages 25-34) with a bachelor’s degree was $45,000.” That’s about $3,750 per month before taxes, which results in about $3,000 after taxes and other pre-tax expenses such as health insurance. Take out your typical household and “young adult” expenses – such as grabbing a drink with friends on a Friday night and paying student loans, of course – and you may be left with $250 per month to save towards your home purchase. At this rate, it would take the average young homebuyer over five years to be able to buy a $200,000 home.</p>
<p>What if the average young homebuyer didn’t have to make the monthly student loan payments? Well, the average payment on a standard 10-year repayment plan for someone owing $25,000 is $290 per month. Free from this monthly payment, this young homebuyer could now save an additional $290 towards their home purchase, bringing the monthly savings to $540 per month ($290 plus the $250 from before). At this rate, it would take them about 2.5 years to be ready, not 5+ years. Considering the millions of young homebuyers out there with student debt, you can clearly see the impact this has on the housing market and on our economy. And it doesn’t end there…</p>
<h2>Debt-to-income ratio</h2>
<p>The Debt-to-Income Ratio (known as DTI) is simply your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income. Ideally, your DTI should be between 36% and 45%.</p>
<p>Monthly student loan payments must be factored into your DTI (even if they’re currently in deferment). Assuming the same monthly pre-tax income of $3,750 and monthly student loan payment of $290, the weight of student loans on DTI is about 8% ($290 divided by $3,750).</p>
<p>What does this mean in practical terms? Using a simple <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>, this means that this homebuyer can purchase about $50,000 less home because the maximum monthly mortgage payment they can afford is $290 lower.</p>
<p>The million-dollar question (pun somewhat intended) is what to do about our country’s growing student debt crisis. Do we offer more low-cost financing options to students? Should we increase our funding for grants and scholarships to deserving students with financial needs? The solution must somehow involve controlling the cost of education more effectively.</p>
<p>This author is very interested in hearing your thoughts on this topic. Let the conversation begin!</p>

<p>Every so often, we at <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a> like to feature great content from our friends in the real estate industry. Today&#8217;s blog post on renting vs. buying comes courtesy of Russell Wojcik from <a href="http://newmanknowschicago.com/">Newman Realty</a>. We&#8217;ll let Russell take it from here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*   *   *</p>
<p>&#8220;Owning vs renting&#8221; survives as one of the most common debates in the real estate market. Recent analysis shows that even with mortgage rates and home prices increasing, signing on for the long haul still ends up cheaper than paying month-to-month.<span id="more-304"></span></p>
<p><a title="Chicago Rent Magazine" href="http://chicagoagentmagazine.com/owning-chicago-47-cheaper-renting/" target="_blank">Chicago Rent Magazine</a> analyzed data published by <a title="Trulia" href="http://trends.truliablog.com/2014/02/rent-vs-buy-winter-2014/" target="_blank">Trulia</a> and came up with two numbers of interest to Chicago residents. First: Owning is 47% cheaper than renting in Chicago. Second: Interest rates will have to climb to 15% in order for renting to become more affordable than owning. When comparing the numbers from last year (50% and 15%, respectively) evidently ownership cost did take a hit due to a slight increase in home costs and interest rates, but the hit was minimal and owning still wins out.</p>
<p>Trulia and Chicago Rent Magazine analyze costs based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.5% mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan</li>
<li>Buyers put 20% down when purchasing</li>
<li>Buyers itemize their federal deductions</li>
<li>Buyers are in the 25% tax bracket</li>
<li>Buyers will own the home for 7 years</li>
</ul>
<p>Trulia calculates its numbers based on essentially identical properties listed on their website, in order to analyze costs in relation to what the resident will pay for the same home. They also incorporate costs of renting and owning, going beyond mortgage payment and rent to include maintenance, insurance, and taxes as well as economic factors that affect cost and future sale prices. They also factor in the larger chunks of cash involved in either situation, such as down payments and security deposits.</p>
<p>Trulia goes on to explain how home price appreciation affects the cost of ownership, and that even in the worst case scenario—with home values not appreciating—buying still costs less than renting in most situations and locations.</p>
<p>While every individual operates in a unique situation (income, savings, credit, etc.), the general state of Chicago’s real estate market today is clear: buy a home and enjoy a significant savings over renting.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has the capacity to buy—perhaps you’re thinking of moving to a new city in a few years, or you just don’t have the cash right now for a down payment. The rental market still has a great outlook, and there are plenty of beautiful apartments available right now. Just be sure to do your research on buying—you could be in better shape than you think, and you could save a whole heap of money.</p>
<p>Get in touch with Newman Realty and figure out what your best option is by calling 773.313.3901 or emailing blog@newmanrealtyillinois.com.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">One of the most important things you can do when you <a title="Morty’s House-Hunting Tips and Essentials" href="/blog/mortys-house-hunting-tips-essentials/">begin your home search</a> is determine how much home you can afford. In this installment of Morty&#8217;s Whiteboard, we’re going to walk you through the home affordability analysis so that you can go home-hunting like an expert.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that at MortgageHippo, we’ve built a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> to make figuring out home affordability a breeze, so don’t sweat the math.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok, let’s get started.<span id="more-251"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Home Affordability: Down Payment</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are two factors that determine how much home you can afford: your <a title="Is Saving 20% for the Down Payment on a Home Really Your Best Bet?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/pt-i-20-percent-down-payment-on-a-home/" target="_blank">down payment</a> and the maximum monthly mortgage payment you can afford, according to guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The down payment part is very simple: how much money do you have available for a down payment?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Different loan programs have different guidelines on where your down payment can come from (e.g., <a title="What to Know Before Receiving a Down Payment Gift" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/receiving-down-payment-gift/" target="_blank">down payment gift</a> from parents, etc.), but for now let’s just assume you have <strong>$15,000</strong> in the bank ready to be used for your down payment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since many loan programs need a minimum of 5% down, the maximum loan amount you’ll be able to qualify for based on down payment alone is <strong>$300,000</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ll come back to this number at the end of our analysis to make sure we’re not looking for a property that exceeds this amount.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Home Affordability: Maximum Monthly Mortgage Payment</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Down payment was cake, right? Gear up, figuring out the monthly payment affordability part isn&#8217;t quite as simple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are several factors to consider here: the interest rate on your loan (impacted by your <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">credit score</a>), the loan term, property taxes and insurance, your gross monthly income, your monthly debt obligations (credit cards, car payments, student loans, etc.), and the Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio (expected monthly mortgage expense plus other monthly debt obligations divided by your monthly income) permitted by the loan program.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“You lost me at ‘several factors’.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok, fair enough. To simplify our example, let’s make the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Loan Term:</strong> 30 years</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Interest Rate (based on a credit score of 720):</strong> 4.375%</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Property taxes and Insurance:</strong> $330/month</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>DTI Ratio permitted by loan program:</strong> up to 43%</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Gross Monthly Income:</strong> $5,000</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Monthly Debt Obligations:</strong> $650</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s take a quick look at the formula to determine your monthly payment affordability:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Max. Monthly Payment = (Gross Monthly Income x DTI Ratio) – Monthly Debt Obligations</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Now let’s plug in some numbers based on the assumptions above:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Max. Monthly Payment = ($5,000 x 0.43) &#8211; $650</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">So&#8230;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Max. Monthly Payment = $1,500</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This maximum monthly payment includes <a title="Mortgage Calculator | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-calculator-to-calculate-monthly-mortgage-payments/">principal, interest, taxes, and insurance</a>. But what really matters when figuring out what loan amount you can afford is to just look at principal and interest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So let’s subtract $330 from the Max. Monthly Payment of $1,500, leaving us with a <strong>Maximum Monthly Principal &amp; Interest </strong>of<strong> $1,170</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on this Max. Monthly Principal &amp; Interest, the maximum loan amount for which you would qualify at the assumed interest rate of 4.375% on a 30-year loan is <strong>$234,334.98</strong>. Boom!</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Wait, where did you get that number from? Well, we have a serious <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> that we built for ourselves and our customers.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to keep your DTI Ratio in the safe zone of 36%, instead of 43%, the maximum loan amount for which you would qualify is <strong>$164,234.77</strong>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Home Affordability: Property Price</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Now let’s add your $15,000 down payment to these two loan amounts to determine your property price range:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ideal Property Price = $164,235 + $15,000 = $179,235</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Upper Limit Property Price = $234,335 + $15,000 = $249,335</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, let’s get back to our down payment limit of $300,000 to check the upper limit property price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your upper limit exceeded $300,000, you would be constrained by the amount you have available for a down payment. In this case, your upper limit of $250k is below your down payment limit, so we’re good!</p>
<p dir="ltr">So how much house can you afford given this analysis? Between $180k and $250K. The closer you stay to your ideal price of $180k, the better, but it’s also good to know you can stretch a little if you find your dream house.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</p>
<p dir="ltr">We agree, figuring out &#8220;how much home can I afford?&#8221; can get a little complicated. The good news is that, at MortgageHippo, we’re developing the smartest mortgage tool out there to seamlessly walk <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a> through this and other mortgage decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So put your calculator down and enjoy your home buying experience to the fullest!</p>
