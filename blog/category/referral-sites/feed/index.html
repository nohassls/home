				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We’ve been very critical about how mortgage referral sites love to <a title="Why we don't like mortgage referral sites" href="/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites">advertise deceivingly low interest rates</a>, see who bites, and make millions by selling your information to lenders. But what happens when you do bite?</p>
<p dir="ltr">We make it a point at <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a> to listen to our customers’ home buying stories, and sharing them with the <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a> community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today we want to share a fascinating story of a technologist who is a veteran of the traditional homebuying/refinance process, decided to try a popular online mortgage referral site, and was ultimately left dissatisfied with their model.<span id="more-114"></span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Learning to Trust Again</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The following is a verbatim transcription of the conversation we had with this veteran technologist, used with permission:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“I bought my first home in 2000, when I was 23 years old. Nobody thinks they’re part of the housing bubble until they look back ten years later thinking, ‘What the hell was I doing buying a house at 23?’</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“At that time, I remember that there were some understandable hoops when it came to loan-to-income ratio. We were fresh out of school and there was a lot of loan-to-value ratio wackiness that was admittedly more liberal in 2000 than it is now.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“I remember working directly with a lot of brick and mortar banks, who I assumed might be able to get me a good loan, and finally settled on one. A couple years later, rates had come down markedly from around the 8% range in 2000 to about the mid 6% range, so we decided to refinance with another commercial bank.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Being a very digital guy, working in technology research and development at the time, I found [Popular Mortgage Referral Site]. I started using them on my most recent purchase because, hey, ‘when banks compete, I win!’ So I hopped on the site, entered in a bunch of personal data and was provided a bunch of rates that looked amazing – but almost too compelling, because they were so much more superior to the banks I had previously dealt with.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“It turned out, of course, that a non-trivial percent of the providers didn’t have a lot of scruples. I ended up going with the second best looking deal on [Popular Mortgage Referral Site] and entered a carnival of paperwork and traditional phone calls that became decidedly non-digital due to the fact that I was ultimately sold to a lender in their referral network.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“The biggest kick in the pants? Some huge unexpected fees started to emerge, and I ended up walking away out several hundred dollars of non-refundable fees. After some post facto research, I found out that these guys were B- students with the Better Business Bureau. Needless to say, [Popular Mortgage Referral Site] left a bad taste in my mouth.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Where that left me was in an uncharacteristically 1960s place of ‘I’m just going to go with this local guy who I know that doesn’t seem to be screwing me that bad.’ Everything else in my life was becoming digital, digital, digital, but there was this old school part of my life of going to this local guy who I talk to on the phone and he does some sort of craziness on the back end. In the end, it seems like a good deal: all I know is that my rate is down and my payments are down. In retrospect, I came to know that he’s buying loans from big commercial banks and charging me a comparatively ‘okay’ rate and getting by on the spread.”</em></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">We Deserve Better</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, this is a very <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/lending_tree.html">common story</a> for people who use online mortgage referral sites… and the crazy thing is that these companies continue to grow! When you believe customers are only <a title="Why do mortgage companies love advertising low interest rates?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/">looking for the lowest interest rates</a>, there’s an incredible incentive to mislead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the way, this odd paradox of achieving <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/if-you-use-a-big-bank-you-deserve-to-be-treated-like-crap/">growth while continually misleading customers</a> isn’t just confined to the mortgage industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As we’ve previously said, we’re as tired as most are of <a title="Where's the value in being misled?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/wheres-value-shopping-mortgage/">misleading mortgage referral sites</a> that are looking to make a quick buck and pass you off to the next guy, without providing any real value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why we built a tool that <a title="How It Works | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/howitworks">walks you through</a> the entire mortgage process, without letting you make any mistakes along the way, and without assuming anything about you other than that you are interested in securing the best mortgage for your specific needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopping for a mortgage online is like going through a maze of mediocre websites and misinformation. The fact is that a lot of mortgage companies have gotten lazy: “Interest rates are at their lowest level! Let me ask you just a few questions and I’ll get you the lowest rate on the market!”</p>
<p>It’s easy to throw out <a title="Why do mortgage companies love advertising low interest rates?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/">low mortgage interest rates</a> and APRs. We’re all attracted to the shiny objects.</p>
<p>Imagine a regular homebuyer shopping for a mortgage on Google and ending up on one of these <a title="Why We Don’t Like Mortgage Referral Sites (And Why You Shouldn’t Either)" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites/" target="_blank">mortgage referral sites</a>. Most of these sites think, “Ok, he’s here. He’s gotta be looking for the lowest rate possible, so let’s feed it to him!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the person doesn’t really know what loan type and loan features he’s looking for. He simply knows, “I’ve heard about a lot of people getting into trouble with their mortgages and I want to make sure I get the best deal for my specific needs and profile.”</p>
<p>How effective is it to assume a borrower knows what he or she wants <i>before</i> shopping for a mortgage?<span id="more-92"></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of these mortgage sites will <a title="Mortgage Calculator | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-calculator-to-calculate-monthly-mortgage-payments/">throw tools and calculators</a> at you and expect you to have the time and know-how to figure out what your specific needs are.</p>
<h2>When it comes to finding the right mortgage, what do people REALLY want?</h2>
<p>99% of people care about getting a mortgage that’s right for them and have peace of mind. They could care less about learning the intricacies of the mortgage industry, fiddling with calculators, or following rates.</p>
<p>How do we know?</p>
<p>Before developing the mortgage algorithms behind MortgageHippo, we immersed ourselves in customer discovery and collected hundreds of data points along the way.</p>
<p>We went out into the world and talked to nearly everyone who would talk to us: <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a>, homeowners, <a title="When Should You Use a Real Estate Agent to Buy a Home?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-should-you-use-a-real-estate-agent-to-buy-a-home/" target="_blank">real estate agents</a>, mortgage loan originators, etc.</p>
<p>We visited almost every neighborhood in Chicago in search of answers.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand why so many Americans were ecstatic to buy a home but cringed at the thought of getting a mortgage, and why the most common words we kept hearing were: “confusing,” “intimidating” and “overwhelming.”</p>
<p>As I said, we were looking for answers.</p>
<p>Here are some things we learned:</p>
<p><b>People want…</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To understand the total costs involved, including <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">mortgage closing costs</a>, and not worry about being able to afford their monthly payments</li>
<li>To be in control</li>
<li>To get personalized, tailored recommendations for their personal situation</li>
<li>To get guidance throughout the entire application process from someone they trust</li>
<li>To take pride in the fact that they got a great deal (nobody really mentions the social aspect of personal finance)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>People do NOT want…</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To have to “learn” about the mortgage industry as a whole. They only care about their situation</li>
<li>To learn the industry jargon: FHA, VA, ARMs, buydown points, FHA, Fannie and Freddie, etc.</li>
<li>To have to calculate the numbers on their own to figure out which loans are better suited for their needs</li>
<li>To be teased with mortgage quotes offering interest rates and closing fees that they may not qualify</li>
</ul>
<p>These are no-brainers. You’d think most mortgage companies would understand all this, right? Here are more specific examples:</p>
<p>AWESOME: “Here’s an <a title="How It Works | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/howitworks">automated mortgage process</a> to generate loan offers based on your personal profile, and here’s <a title="HippoScore | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/hipposcore">the loan we recommend</a> above all others”</p>
<p>SUCKS: “Here are some low-rate loan offers that you <i>may or may not</i> qualify for. Click and see!” (Ughhh…)</p>
<p>AWESOME: “Here is your own mortgage closing plan to help you keep your application documents organized and in one place and know exactly what to expect from the <a title="What to Expect from the Mortgage Process" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/what_to_expect" target="_blank">entire mortgage process</a>. You’ll also be able to communicate directly with a personal mortgage guide to help you through any issues you may run into.”</p>
<p>SUCKS: “You’ve just selected a loan offer! We’re going to pass you off to someone else now. See ya later, and thanks for your Social Security number!” (Uhhh…what??)</p>
<p>AWESOME: “Here is a complete list of fees associated with these loan offers so you can fully assess and compare your offers.”</p>
<p>SUCKS: “APR and Payment examples shown do not include amounts for taxes and insurance premiums” (This is from a real referral site)</p>
<h2>What business are referral sites really in?</h2>
<p>There’s a very good reason these mortgage referral sites don’t even see themselves as mortgage companies. They aren’t.</p>
<p>They see themselves as marketing companies, because they are in effect providing a marketing function for the mortgage lenders that <a title="Why we don't like mortgage referral sites" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites/">advertise rates and fees on those sites</a>.</p>
<p>We’re as tired as most are of misleading mortgage tools that are looking to make a quick buck and pass you off to the next guy, without providing any real value. That’s why we built a system that walks you through the entire mortgage process without assuming anything other than that you are interested in securing the best mortgage for your specific needs and profile.</p>
<p>As we’ve said, it’s easy to advertise <a title="Why do mortgage companies love advertising low interest rates?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/">low mortgage interest rates</a> and get people’s attention. But marketing is not just advertising. Marketing is deeply understanding your audience—their fears, their motivations, their desires—and designing an end-to-end customer experience that adds real value to their lives.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The simple reason is: because mortgage referral sites mislead our customers – the mortgage borrower – into believing that getting a good deal on a home loan is all about low <a title="How Are Mortgage Interest Rates Calculated?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-mortgage-interest-rates-calculated/" target="_blank">mortgage interest rates</a> and fees.</p>
<p>Everything else being equal, low interest rates and low fees win, but rarely is everything else equal. Without a full analysis of your situation, there’s a chance that getting the lowest rate or lowest fee on a home loan will NOT result in the best possible deal for you.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at these referral sites:<span id="more-52"></span></p>
<p>What’s a mortgage referral site? It’s one of those websites that ask you just a few questions about yourself and the type of loan you’re looking for, and then spit out a ton of different loan offers to you.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen these, right? They use catchy slogans promising you that you win when they make banks compete for your business.</p>
<p>How do these sites make money? From referral fees. What’s a referral? You are.</p>
<p>You go on their site and you tell them “hey, I’m looking for a mortgage.” They show you some quotes, you click on the quote you like (usually the one with the lowest interest rate or fees – because that’s what they make you think is best for you) and you contact that lender for more information about the quote.</p>
<p>By simply “referring” you to that lender, they earned themselves a referral fee. Of course, there are slight variations in their business models from one site to another, but this is basically what they’re all about. There are hundreds of these sites out there.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with these sites? From a consumer standpoint, a lot.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who’s their customer, you or the mortgage lender? If you define customer as the one who pays them, then the lender is definitely their customer. If so, are they doing what’s in your best interest or the lender’s?</li>
<li>These sites do not provide consumers, especially <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a>, with the right guidance to choose the best mortgage for their needs. Why? Because they’re not in the business of getting you the best loan for your needs. They’re in the business of maximizing their referral fees. All they talk about in these sites are “interest rates” and “fees,” conditioning you, the customer, to believe that this is <a title="Why do Mortgage Companies Love Advertising Low Rates? | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/" target="_blank">all that matters when</a> getting a mortgage.</li>
<li>Many of these sites don’t allow you to compare apples-to-apples. One of these sites, for example, lumps in loan offers with 30-day <a title="Morty’s Whiteboard Series: Rate Locks" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/rate-locks-whiteboard/" target="_blank">rate locks</a> together with loan offers with 60-day rate locks. Additionally, many of these don’t even show you all the fees you will need to pay at closing. How are you supposed to make a fair apples-to-apples comparison if you don’t have all the information?</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re as tired as most are of misleading mortgage referral sites that are looking to make a quick buck and pass you off to the next guy, without providing any real value.</p>
<p>That’s why we built a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> and automated closing plan that walks you through <a title="How it Works | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/howitworks" target="_blank">the entire mortgage process</a>, without letting you make any mistakes along the way, and without assuming anything about you other than that you are interested in securing the best mortgage for your specific needs.</p>
