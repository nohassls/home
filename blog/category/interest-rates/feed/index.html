				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff0000;">WARNING:</span> This post is best suited for finance geeks and normal people who own a home or are looking to buy and hope to better understand mortgage interest rates. You’ve been forewarned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As many of you already know, most lenders are in business to make profits. The way they do so is by charging you interest for the privilege of letting you use their money to buy stuff – whether it’s a new pair of shoes, a car, or a home. The amount of interest you pay is determined by the interest rate the lender charges you. The interest rate the lender charges you, in turn, is heavily influenced by two factors: (1) the general interest rate market, and (2) risk-based pricing (your assessed level of risk as a borrower).<span id="more-437"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The General Interest Rate Market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage rates are more sensitive to market fluctuations than most other loans. See, these days most mortgage loans are sold on the secondary market and securitized into large pools of loans with similar characteristics. These pools of loans, known as Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), are bonds sold to investors and whose prices are determined by market conditions. As the prices of MBSs fluctuate in the market, so do mortgage interest rates. And since no investment is analyzed in a vacuum, because investors have choices when it comes to where they invest their money, MBS prices are heavily influenced by the prices of other bonds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So now let’s take a deeper look into bond pricing&#8230;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bond prices are typically analyzed relative to market benchmarks. These benchmarks tend to be “risk-free” treasuries backed by the U.S. government (and let me tell you, that’s quite some backing). In the case of MBSs, for example, the most commonly-used benchmark is the 10-year Treasury.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, since the majority of bonds are not risk-free (because no entity out there has the credit reputation of good ‘ole Uncle Sam), there are several premiums used in bond pricing to compensate investors for expected and unexpected risks to which investors in “risk-free” investments are not exposed (or at least not to the same extent). These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inflation Premium:</strong> the underlying concept is that your uninvested cash loses its value with every day that passes due to inflation. One dollar today is expected to lose some of its value by tomorrow, and that’s why investors expect to be compensated for the loss of principal caused by inflation (or have you ever heard an investor bragging about just keeping up with inflation?). To make up for that decrease in value due to inflation, investors require a rate of return above and beyond the rate of inflation. Therefore, as the rate of inflation rises, so do market interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Premium:</strong> No, this has nothing to do with water. This addresses the ease of converting a particular investment into cash. The quicker and easier it is to sell the bond, the more liquid it is. Liquidity is determined by the market’s supply and demand forces. If your security is highly desirable, such as highly rated corporate bonds or U.S. Treasury bonds, it is considered to be liquid. Conversely, it might be considerably more difficult to find a buyer for a junk bond, making it less liquid.</li>
<li><strong>Default Risk Premium:</strong> this is connected to the probability of the debt not being repaid by the borrower. On one end of the risk spectrum, we have U.S. treasuries, which are considered to be virtually risk-free because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. On the other end of the risk spectrum, junk bonds carry a high risk of default. The higher the level of default risk, the higher the investor’s required level of compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Prepayment Risk Premium:</strong> this reflects the possibility that an investor may lose future cash flows because a borrower decides to repay the loan (or underlying loan) before the maturity date. In the case of a MBS, for example, an investor’s returns come from your monthly mortgage payment. If you sell your home or refinance the loan, the investor loses the expected cash flow stream associated with your contribution to the MBS pool.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity Risk Premium:</strong> this compensates investors for tying up their money for a long period of time, during which they are exposed to interest rate uncertainty and volatility. Bonds with shorter term maturities have a lower maturity risk premium than ones with long term maturities.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Whew! Ok, so to bring it all back, here’s the short answer to how the market affects the interest rates offered by your lender: fluctuating economic conditions affect the bond markets (including MBSs), which in turn affects the interest rates mortgage lenders offer to the public.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Risk-Based Pricing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The concept behind risk-based pricing is that not every borrower is equal in terms of the risk they present to a lender. Some borrowers are riskier than others, and therefore a lender will adjust the interest rate it offers to a particular borrower based on the lender’s assessment of that borrower’s risk level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A borrower’s credit history is the biggest indicator of risk to a lender. As such, your <a title="How To Improve Your Credit Score" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score/" target="_blank">credit score</a> is the most determinative factor influencing the interest rate you pay on your mortgage. It’s very simple: the higher your credit score, the lower your assessed risk level, and therefore the lower your interest rate. We cannot emphasize enough how important it is to keep track of your credit (but more on that topic later).</p>
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to mortgages, there are several other factors that also affect your interest rate (though not as much as your credit score). Loan-to-Value (LTV) is one of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loan-to-Value is your loan amount divided by the value of the property. If you’re buying a $250,000 home, for example, and you put down $50,000, your resulting loan amount is $200,000, and your LTV, therefore, is 80% (i.e., $200,000 divided by $250,000). To bring it back to the issue of risk, a lower LTV means you have more equity in your home, and therefore present a lower risk of default. As such, the lower your LTV, the lower your interest rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Property type also plays a role in determining your interest rate. Condos, for example, can have slightly higher interest rates than other property types. See, when you buy a condo, you’re buying a unit in a building where the rest of the units are owned by other people. The building’s homeowners’ association relies on HOA dues to maintain the building. If you or the other unit owners can’t pay those dues, the property would not be maintained and the value of the building and the individual units could go down. This presents an additional risk to a lender that is reflected in the interest rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another factor that plays into your interest rate is the loan type. A 15-year fixed, for example, because of its shorter maturity, offers a lower interest rate than a 30-year fixed. Adjustable rate mortgages, well, adjust (or fluctuate) based on market conditions. However, they do typically offer lower initial interest rates than fixed rate mortgages, making them great products for some borrowers (see why <a title="Adjustable Rate Mortgages Are Not Evil" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/adjustable-rate-mortgages-not-evil/" target="_blank">Adjustable Rate Mortgages are not evil</a>, they’re just not for everyone).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your intended use of the property also affects your loan’s interest rate. For example, the interest rate you pay to buy an investment property is higher than what you pay to buy a primary home. Buyers are less likely to default on their primary home than on an investment property, therefore making them a lower risk for the lender.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, there are certain factors a lender may NOT use to adjust the interest rate they offer you. These are factors <a title="You Could Be Denied A Loan Just For Being Gay" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/denied-loan-just-for-being-gay/" target="_blank">protected by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> (ECOA); they are: race, color, religion, national origin, sex (gender), marital status, age (if the applicant is old enough to enter into a contract), or receipt of income from a public assistance program. Your rate is also unaffected if you&#8217;re a <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyer</a>. Adjusting your interest rate based on any of these factors would constitute discrimination, and, as you may know, that’s a big no-no.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that everything is, I’m sure, clear as mud as to how mortgage interest rates are determined, let us know if you have any questions or comments. Just kidding, hopefully this was very useful and not too difficult to digest, but please do drop off any questions or comments below. To find out what mortgage interest rate you&#8217;ll likely qualify for, use our <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We’ve been very critical about how mortgage referral sites love to <a title="Why we don't like mortgage referral sites" href="/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites">advertise deceivingly low interest rates</a>, see who bites, and make millions by selling your information to lenders. But what happens when you do bite?</p>
<p dir="ltr">We make it a point at <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a> to listen to our customers’ home buying stories, and sharing them with the <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a> community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today we want to share a fascinating story of a technologist who is a veteran of the traditional homebuying/refinance process, decided to try a popular online mortgage referral site, and was ultimately left dissatisfied with their model.<span id="more-114"></span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Learning to Trust Again</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The following is a verbatim transcription of the conversation we had with this veteran technologist, used with permission:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“I bought my first home in 2000, when I was 23 years old. Nobody thinks they’re part of the housing bubble until they look back ten years later thinking, ‘What the hell was I doing buying a house at 23?’</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“At that time, I remember that there were some understandable hoops when it came to loan-to-income ratio. We were fresh out of school and there was a lot of loan-to-value ratio wackiness that was admittedly more liberal in 2000 than it is now.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“I remember working directly with a lot of brick and mortar banks, who I assumed might be able to get me a good loan, and finally settled on one. A couple years later, rates had come down markedly from around the 8% range in 2000 to about the mid 6% range, so we decided to refinance with another commercial bank.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Being a very digital guy, working in technology research and development at the time, I found [Popular Mortgage Referral Site]. I started using them on my most recent purchase because, hey, ‘when banks compete, I win!’ So I hopped on the site, entered in a bunch of personal data and was provided a bunch of rates that looked amazing – but almost too compelling, because they were so much more superior to the banks I had previously dealt with.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“It turned out, of course, that a non-trivial percent of the providers didn’t have a lot of scruples. I ended up going with the second best looking deal on [Popular Mortgage Referral Site] and entered a carnival of paperwork and traditional phone calls that became decidedly non-digital due to the fact that I was ultimately sold to a lender in their referral network.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“The biggest kick in the pants? Some huge unexpected fees started to emerge, and I ended up walking away out several hundred dollars of non-refundable fees. After some post facto research, I found out that these guys were B- students with the Better Business Bureau. Needless to say, [Popular Mortgage Referral Site] left a bad taste in my mouth.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Where that left me was in an uncharacteristically 1960s place of ‘I’m just going to go with this local guy who I know that doesn’t seem to be screwing me that bad.’ Everything else in my life was becoming digital, digital, digital, but there was this old school part of my life of going to this local guy who I talk to on the phone and he does some sort of craziness on the back end. In the end, it seems like a good deal: all I know is that my rate is down and my payments are down. In retrospect, I came to know that he’s buying loans from big commercial banks and charging me a comparatively ‘okay’ rate and getting by on the spread.”</em></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">We Deserve Better</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, this is a very <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/lending_tree.html">common story</a> for people who use online mortgage referral sites… and the crazy thing is that these companies continue to grow! When you believe customers are only <a title="Why do mortgage companies love advertising low interest rates?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/mortgage-companies-love-advertising-low-interest-rates/">looking for the lowest interest rates</a>, there’s an incredible incentive to mislead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the way, this odd paradox of achieving <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/if-you-use-a-big-bank-you-deserve-to-be-treated-like-crap/">growth while continually misleading customers</a> isn’t just confined to the mortgage industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As we’ve previously said, we’re as tired as most are of <a title="Where's the value in being misled?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/wheres-value-shopping-mortgage/">misleading mortgage referral sites</a> that are looking to make a quick buck and pass you off to the next guy, without providing any real value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why we built a tool that <a title="How It Works | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/howitworks">walks you through</a> the entire mortgage process, without letting you make any mistakes along the way, and without assuming anything about you other than that you are interested in securing the best mortgage for your specific needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Nobody has a crystal ball telling them where interest rates will be moving over the next few months, and this is why locking your <a title="How Are Mortgage Interest Rates Calculated?" href="/blog/how-mortgage-interest-rates-calculated/" target="_blank">mortgage interest rate</a> often makes sense: it protects you from uncertainty and volatility in the market by guaranteeing a set interest rate over a set period of time.<span id="more-104"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">If your interest rate goes up, so does your <a title="Infographic: Monthly Mortgage Payment and Closing Costs Breakdown" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/monthly-mortgage-payment-breakdown/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage payment</a> – this could prevent you from qualifying for your home loan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some lenders don’t even charge a fee for locking your rate, making it an even more attractive option for the typical borrower. If they do charge, many lenders simply build this cost into the interest rate you’re locking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Be sure to ask your loan officer if you are uncertain whether there is a cost.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How do rate locks work?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Lenders will typically let you lock your interest rate for a period of 30, 45, or even 60 days (or longer than 60 days in some cases).</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, if you lock your rate today (November 27) at 4.50%, this same interest rate will be available for you if you close your loan by December 27, even if rates move above 4.50%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What happens if interest rates go down between now and December 27? Well, it would be really nice to have your cake and it eat it too, right?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some lock contracts have “float-down” provisions that give you the flexibility to lock at a lower interest rate if one becomes available before your loan closing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, most lenders won’t let you do this. If they do, it often comes at a significant cost to you.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">When should I lock my rate and for how long?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The answer depends on your circumstances.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’ve already signed a purchase agreement on your home and the type of documentation your lender requires is readily available, then you should be able to lock your rate as soon as you’re approved and close within 30 days (in which case a 30-day lock is sufficient).</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, if you’re purchasing a short sale, there’s no point on even locking your rate until the seller’s lender approves it. This could take months!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Final words of wisdom on rate locks</h2>
<p dir="ltr">All in all, we usually recommend locking your rate more often than we recommend letting it float, but we strongly suggest that you take the time to think it through.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are two more parting thoughts on rate locks:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Discuss the rate lock thoroughly with your loan officer. A good loan officer will help you understand all the pros and cons as well as help you determine when to lock, for how long and whether it makes sense for you to pay for a float-down (if available).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Keep track of the rate lock expiration date and don’t just rely on your loan officer (even if you’re working with the best).  Take control over your mortgage process and make sure that you submit all required documentation on time to keep the process running smoothly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">To help you keep track of your rate lock, as well as all of your mortgage application documents and deadlines, we’ve built an easy-to-use <a href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">Mortgage Loan Closing Plan </a>with access to a personal MortgageHippo mortgage guide and the most advanced <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> out there.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Morty&#8217;s Whiteboard series</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Morty&#8217;s Whiteboard series will not only give you the knowledge and information to help better understand your mortgage options, but will also help you make sense of that information and apply it to your personal situation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mortgage “experts” focus almost exclusively on sharing encyclopedic information on mortgages (e.g., what specific loan terms mean, where rates are going, how to pay points, etc.).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, information is always important.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, what these “experts” often ignore is giving you the right tools to make good use of that information. Think about this: How far would a homebuilder go without a hammer and saw? Blueprints alone are simply not enough if you don’t have the right tools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">MortgageHippo</a>, we share valuable information with you but focus equally on the tools; because with the right tools, the information is turbocharged and ultimately made more useful. That’s our goal for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right mortgage calculator is very important to correctly estimate your monthly mortgage payment. Unfortunately, most mortgage calculators available in search results are not very accurate and, to be blunt, pretty useless. Don&#8217;t believe me, just watch!&#8230;sorry Bruno Mars. Let&#8217;s look at an example.</p>
<p>Katie currently rents an apartment in the city for $1,200/month. She and her husband Mark <a title="When is the right time to buy a home | MortgageHippo" href="/blog/when-is-the-right-time-to-buy-a-home/">want to buy a home</a> to raise a family in and think they can afford a house in the <strong>$250,000</strong> range.</p>
<p>They know that their monthly payment cannot be higher than $1,500. They also know that there is a high possibility that Mark could get transferred for work within the next five years. They’ve made a point of saving as much as possible for a down payment and figure they can afford to put down 5%, or $12,500.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Rent Payment: <strong>$1,200</strong></li>
<li>Prospective Home Value: <strong>$250,000</strong></li>
<li>Down Payment: <strong>$12,500</strong></li>
<li>Maximum monthly payment they can afford: <strong>$1,500</strong></li>
<li>Time expected to stay in the home: <strong>5 years or less</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much can Katie and her husband expect as their total monthly mortgage payment?<span id="more-59"></span></p>
<p>There are a number of online <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculators</a> that Katie can choose to estimate her <a title="Infographic: Monthly Mortgage Payment and Closing Costs Breakdown" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/monthly-mortgage-payment-breakdown/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage payments</a>, however the vast majority of calculators don’t include key factors that greatly affect accuracy.</p>
<p>What should you look for in a mortgage calculator to make sure you’re getting an accurate estimate of what you’ll be paying in monthly mortgage payments? Generally, there are three questions you should ask yourself, which we consider requirements for an accurate calculation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the calculator take into account the principal, interest rate, taxes, homeowners insurance, and mortgage insurance (PITI)?</li>
<li>Does the calculator let you compare between Fixed Rate and Adjustable Rate mortgages?</li>
<li>Does the calculator include up-to-date mortgage interest rates that reflect current market rates?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s choose the fifteen most popular online mortgage calculators (based on Google search results) and assess whether they pass or fail these three requirements, and how each would affect Katie’s monthly payment estimate:</p>
<h2><strong>PITI</strong></h2>
<p>Katie and her husband might be tempted to think “Ok, we currently pay $1200/month for our apartment in the city, so if we get a 4.51% interest rate on the $237,500 loan we’ll only be paying $1,205/month…we can afford that, and we’ll be building equity!”</p>
<p>If only it were that easy.</p>
<p>The $1,205 only accounts for the principal and interest, however she’ll also have to add in taxes, homeowners insurance, and <a title="What is Private Mortgage Insurance and How Can I Get Rid of It?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/get-rid-of-private-mortgage-insurance/" target="_blank">private mortgage insurance</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the same principal and interest rate on a <b>30-year fixed mortgage</b>, but add in the rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Value: $250,000</li>
<li>Down Payment: $12,500</li>
<li>Interest Rate: 4.51%</li>
<li>Principal and Interest: $1,205</li>
<li>Property Taxes: $3,000/year</li>
<li>Homeowners Insurance: $900/year</li>
<li>Private Mortgage Insurance: $1,800</li>
<li><strong style="color: #000000; font-style: normal;">Total Monthly Payment: $1,680</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If Katie would have used one of the mortgage calculators in the fail column, she would have started shopping around online for a home in the $250,000 range thinking that she could afford the monthly payment.</p>
<p>Clearly that is not the case. Katie would have lost valuable time looking at pictures of different homes, making lists of must haves and maybe driving around with the <a title="When Should You Use a Real Estate Agent to Buy a Home?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-should-you-use-a-real-estate-agent-to-buy-a-home/" target="_blank">real estate agent</a>, looking at homes she can’t afford.</p>
<h2><strong>ARM vs. Fixed</strong></h2>
<p>Now that Katie and her husband have an idea of the full amount they’ll expect to pay in monthly mortgage payments, they should be all set…right?</p>
<p>Not so fast. Katie and Mark know that he might get transferred in 5 years or less. If so, they might be better off applying for an <a title="Adjustable Rate Mortgages Are Not Evil" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/adjustable-rate-mortgages-not-evil/" target="_blank">adjustable rate mortgage</a> (ARM) rather than a 30-year fixed rate to take advantage of a lower initial interest rate.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the same PITI numbers used above, but this time on a 5/1 ARM with a lower interest rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Monthly Payment (30-year Fixed at 4.51%): <strong>$1680</strong></li>
<li>Total Monthly Payment (5/1 Adjustable at 2.77%): <strong>$1497</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Which of the remaining five online mortgage calculators allow Katie to compare loan programs such as Fixed vs. ARM?</strong></p>

<p>All of a sudden, Katie and Mark realize that maybe they can look at a $250,000 home after all.</p>
<p>Now the decision for them gets a little bit more difficult: “do we get a 5/1 ARM on the $250,000 home and pay the $1,497 a month or do we go for a 30 year fixed and look at a lower priced home (let’s say $225,000) so that the monthly payment fits within our budget? At that point it becomes a question of risk tolerance.</p>
<h2><strong>Interest Rates</strong></h2>
<p>Although Katie and Mark now have a better sense of what their total monthly mortgage payment will be, and are able to compare different loan programs based on their personal situation, their estimated monthly mortgage payment still may not be as accurate as they thought. Why?</p>
<p>Let’s say that Katie used one of the two surviving mortgage calculators: Zillow.</p>
<p>Zillow doesn’t really provide accurate, <a title="Why we don't like mortgage referral sites | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/why-we-dont-like-mortgage-referral-sites/">up-to-date mortgage interest rates</a>. What Zillow does is take an average rate based on the results of their own mortgage marketplace.</p>
<p>This may be inaccurate because their mortgage marketplace offers many loans with discount points and lender credits that may not apply to you. They also assume that you have a credit score between 720 and 739.</p>
<p>For example, as of today (11/14/2013) <a href="http://www.zillow.com">Zillow</a> is showing a 4.128% interest rate when the current market rate is 4.38%</p>
<p>Their mortgage calculator lets you play around with the interest rate, but what if Katie doesn’t know the current market rate?</p>
<p>If Katie isn&#8217;t certain exactly what her mortgage rate will be, her monthly mortgage payment estimate might be way off.</p>

<p>As you can see, figuring out what you can expect to pay in monthly mortgage payments requires a lot of assumptions and calculations on your part.</p>
<p>But what if you don’t want to do all the math. What if you don’t want to be a mortgage expert just to get a great loan for you and your family? Aren&#8217;t mortgage calculators supposed to do all the work so you can kick back and think about where your flat screen is going to go?</p>
<p>We think so, and that’s why we made sure our <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">mortgage calculator</a> includes all of the requirements outlined above.</p>
<p>Not only does <a title="MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com">MortgageHippo</a> provide the most accurate monthly mortgage payment calculation, we use these calculations to recommend loan offers that best fit your personal needs.</p>
<p>What’s the worth in using mortgage calculators that rely on defaults, incomplete information, and a lot of work on your own part?</p>
<p>P.S. – Go for the LED.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every time I see an ad from a mortgage company, it’s all about their super low mortgage rates. I don’t understand their obsession with interest rates other than to grab your attention and pull you into their office if you’re in the market for a mortgage.</p>
<p>We can’t help but be intrigued by the shiny object, sort of like how I can’t help but click on every single Buzzfeed article I see about turning 30 (or <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/emofly/important-cheeto-recipes">this</a>).</p>
<p>Are mortgage companies simply responding to people’s lack of understanding about mortgage products and their fixation on getting low mortgage rates or are mortgage companies actually the drivers of this irrational behavior by consumers?<span id="more-30"></span></p>
<p>The point is: <i>don&#8217;t fall for those stupid ads</i>. Read the fine print.</p>
<p>I just recently saw a mortgage ad flaunting a 3.25% interest rate. When I looked at it closer, that mortgage rate was for a 15-year mortgage and for borrowers with assumed credit scores of 720 or higher. If you can’t afford the higher <a title="Infographic: Monthly Mortgage Payment and Closing Costs Breakdown" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/monthly-mortgage-payment-breakdown/" target="_blank">monthly mortgage payment</a> that come with shorter-term mortgages such as 15-year products, or if you don’t meet the assumed credit score threshold, then that 3.25% is completely unattainable for you.</p>
<p>But it got your attention, and it maybe even got you inside their office or on the phone with them.</p>
<p>What mortgage companies should be advertising is how they will help you find the right mortgage for your needs; and let me kick some knowledge to the masses, it’s not always the one with the lowest mortgage rate.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example:</p>
<p>Jane and her husband Paul just recently got married and have their first child on the way. They are currently renting an apartment in Chicago but want to move out to the suburbs where they can have more room, less noise, and a potentially nosy neighbor.</p>
<p>They decided that becoming <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">first-time home buyers</a> is the way to go and know that this home is just their starter home. They want to have a second child soon, so they figure they’ll need to move again in approximately three years to a larger home with another bedroom.</p>
<p>Jane and Paul talked to their <a title="What is the Difference Between Mortgage Brokers and Mortgage Lenders?" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/difference-mortgage-brokers-direct-mortgage-lenders/" target="_blank">mortgage broker</a> and she presented them with two mortgage options for a $200,000 home loan:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loan A</span> is a 30-year fixed at an interest rate of 4% and closing costs of $5,000.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loan B</span> is a 30-year fixed at an interest rate of 4.5% and closing costs of $1,000.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which loan should Jane and Paul choose?  Let’s take a closer look:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<thead>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="108"><strong>Loan A</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="108"></td>
<td valign="top" width="108"></td>
<td valign="top" width="108"></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216">Upfront <a title="The Ultimate Guide to Mortgage Closing Costs" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/ultimate-guide-mortgage-closing-costs/" target="_blank">Closing Costs</a>: $5,000</td>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216">
<p align="right">$5,000</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" valign="top" width="324">Monthly Payments of $954.83 over 36 months</td>
<td valign="top" width="108">
<p align="right">$34,373.88</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216"></td>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216">
<p align="right"><strong>TOTAL: $39,373.88</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<thead>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="108"><strong>Loan B</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="108"></td>
<td valign="top" width="108"></td>
<td valign="top" width="108"></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216">Upfront Closing Costs: $1,000</td>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216">
<p align="right">$1,000</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" valign="top" width="324">Monthly Payments of $1,103.37 over 36 months</td>
<td valign="top" width="108">
<p align="right">$36,481.32</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216"></td>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="216">
<p align="right"><strong>TOTAL: $37,481.32</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Assuming the rest of the loan features are the same for Loan A and Loan B (e.g., prepayment penalties, etc.), Loan B, which has a higher interest rate, results in nearly $2,000 in savings to Jane and Paul over the expected life of the loan.</p>
<p>In fact, Loan B might be the better option even if Jane and Paul stay in the home for at least 6 years.</p>
<p>So yes, getting a low mortgage rate is nice, but it’s for sure not the only thing to consider when shopping for a mortgage. It’s not even the most important factor, and a good <a title="MortgageHippo" href="https://www.mortgagehippo.com" target="_blank">mortgage calculator</a> will tell you so.</p>
<p>Choosing the right loan for your needs takes <a title="When is the right time to buy a home? | MortgageHippo" href="http://www.mortgagehippo.com/blog/when-is-the-right-time-to-buy-a-home/">giving some thought</a> to what your needs are. Savvy mortgage shoppers take the time to assess where they are today, financially as well as in other ways, and where they want to be in a few years.</p>
<p>As with many things in life, we make decisions based on the best information available to us at the time and adjust as we go. When’s the last time you saw a mortgage company advertising that?</p>
<p>Now back to my Buzzfeed article.</p>
