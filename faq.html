</dt>
<dd>

Our process ensures that you do this the right way, starting with a self-assessment of your needs and financial situation, evaluating offers from multiple lenders and choosing the best fit for you.

<dt><span class='icon'></span>Who is Morty the Hippo?
</dt>
<dd>
He is our “Big Chief” and “Mortgage Guru” – our inspiration.  He is not your typical hippo. He was not raised in the wild, but rather in the concrete jungles of Chicago. When he bought a home for him and his family, he realized how unnecessarily complicated getting a mortgage was and decided to make it his life’s goal to simplify this process for the millions of Americans who go through it every year. Morty is obsessed with restoring fun, simplicity, and transparency to home financing and delivering the best experience to all his customers.

</dt>
<dd>
Find out
<a href="howitworks.html">how MortgageHippo works</a>
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>What is the difference between a mortgage lender and a mortgage broker?
</dt>
<dd>
A mortgage lender underwrites and directly funds the loan for you if you are approved for one of their loan programs. They typically sell the loans they fund to other investors in the secondary mortgage market.
<br>
<br>
A mortgage broker acts as an agent for the borrower and helps the borrower navigate the entire mortgage process. Mortgage brokers typically don’t fund the loans themselves but rather shop around with their network of lenders to find the best deal for the borrower.
<br>
<br>
There are advantages and disadvantages to working with either a lender or a broker. We believe the broker model is more consumer-friendly because of the broker’s ability to shop the market for borrowers.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>How is MortgageHippo different from traditional mortgage companies?
</dt>
<dd>
At MortgageHippo we are obsessed with fun, simplicity and transparency.  Our goal is to bring all of these to the mortgage process. We think technology helps us do this effectively and efficiently, but we don’t just rely on our technology to deliver the best customer experience. We rely on all of our resources, especially our super friendly and knowledgeable team members.
<br>
<br>
Our vision is to go beyond mortgages and build the largest community of homebuyers and homeowners in the United States. Why a community? Because a community is not just about a transaction or a purchase; a community is about helping each other, sharing experiences and coming together for the greater good. In an industry with such imbalance of information as mortgages, we strongly believe a community approach is the right approach to help even the playing field.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>What is Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and how is it different from interest rate?
</dt>
<dd>
APR is a calculation that factors in all the finance charges associated with a home loan and expresses them as a percentage. Interest rate, on the other hand, only factors in the interest charges associated with a loan. APR will always be higher than interest rate because it includes interest charges as well as other charges such as mortgage insurance and origination fees.
<br>
<br>
The purpose of APR is to make the comparison of loan options easy and fair, so that you’re comparing apples-to-apples and not apples-to-oranges. Remember, just because a loan offer has a lower interest rate doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a better option. A loan with a lower interest rate than another may have a higher APR because of all the extra charges.
<br>
<br>
Even though doing an APR comparison of different loan offers is useful, it’s important to go beyond the APR and determine which is the best loan offer to meet your needs.  This is not necessarily the one with the lowest APR either. See, APR is calculated by amortizing the cost of the loan over the entire term of the loan, which is 30 years for most loan programs. If you sell or refinance your home loan before the 30-year period is over, then APR may not be the most accurate tool to help you choose your home loan.
<br>
<br>
We help you make these important decisions along the way as you navigate the mortgage process with us. In fact, our loan options page takes all these variables into account to make it easy for you to choose the right home loan program for your needs.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>Should I choose an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) or a Fixed Rate Mortgage (FRM)?
</dt>
<dd>
It depends on your personal situation. For example, if you’re buying a home for only a few years (because you’re on a temporary job and will be moving back, or because the home you’re buying is your “starter” home and you’ll be looking to upgrade in a few years), it may make sense to take advantage of the lower rates that ARMs offer.
<br>
<br>
This is something we will help you determine as you go through the process with us. In fact, our loan options page takes these scenarios into account when scoring the loan offers presented to you.
</dd>

<!-- What is HippoScore? -->
<!-- %dd -->
<!-- HippoScore is a loan scoring methodology we developed to match you to a home loan that’s right for you. We like to think of ourselves as one of those online matching services, except we match people with home loans.  #{link_to("Learn more about HippoScore", hipposcore_path)}. -->
<dt><span class='icon'></span>Do I need to provide my Social Security Number to use MortgageHippo?
</dt>
<dd>
Not until you’re ready to actually apply for the mortgage. You can navigate the first part of the process without providing us your SSN or any other personally identifying information for that matter.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>What documents will I need to get approved for a mortgage loan?
</dt>
<dd>
It depends on your loan program. Supporting documentation is generally required to verify income and assets. W-2s, tax returns, and bank statements are examples of typical documents you'll need to provide.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>What is loan-to-value or “LTV”?
</dt>
<dd>
LTV is the loan amount divided by the lower of (i) the property purchase price, or (ii) the appraised value of the property. For example, if the purchase price is $200,000 and you are putting a $10,000 down payment, your LTV is 95%.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>What is private mortgage insurance (PMI)?
</dt>
<dd>
PMI is an insurance policy lenders require of borrowers with LTVs greater than 80% to protect the lender against borrower default. All FHA loan programs require mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is the term used for the mortgage insurance for FHA programs.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>What is an FHA loan?
</dt>
<dd>
FHA loans are funded by private lenders but are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Currently, the minimum down payment required for an FHA loan is 3.5% of the purchase price. Most of the closing costs and fees can be included in the loan. We will help you explore whether an FHA loan is right for you.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>Does having a co-borrower help my mortgage application?
</dt>
<dd>
It depends on your co-borrower’s credit history and financial situation. We will help you make this and other important decisions along the way.
</dd>
<dt><span class='icon'></span>How do I evaluate different mortgage offers?
</dt>
<dd>
At MortgageHippo, we strongly believe that in order to better evaluate mortgage offers, you must begin by evaluating your personal financial situation, your needs and preferences and the reason for purchasing the home or refinancing. Maybe you’re purchasing a home as a “starter” home and you plan to upgrade to a larger home in four years. Or maybe you’re on a temporary work assignment in Chicago and will likely go back home after only 3 years. If that is your case, do you really care about locking in an interest rate for 30 years? Probably not. You’ll be long gone out of that mortgage product by then.
<br>
<br>
Every situation is different and it’s important to take the time to understand what your home finance goals are. This is why our process starts with an assessment of your personal situation. Even though there’s no magic formula for doing this, our loan closing plan comes close to it because it takes your personal goals and circumstances into account and matches you to a loan program that is well-suited for you.
</dd>
<dt id='will_shopping_around'><span class='icon'></span>Will shopping around for a mortgage hurt my credit score?
</dt>
<dd>
You have a 30-day window to shop around for mortgages without hurting your score. If a mortgage credit inquiry falls outside that 30-day window, inquiries that fall within a typical shopping period (used to be 14 days and now it’s 45 days) are counted as only one inquiry.
